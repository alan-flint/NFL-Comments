We got the best CB, probably the best RB, while also solidifying our o-line AND d-line. Our 1st 4 picks are pretty well guaranteed starters, And the rest are looking at rotational (the 2 DT's we took late) and\/or special teams (The 2nd RB we took) roles or smaller roles this year that will bloom into larger ones next year (Cephus who is entering a crowded WR room that has a lot of contracts up this year). \n\nObviously the way drafts work it is normal for not every pick to make the team but I can't help but see there being 4 starters minimum (maybe 5 depending on how they handle our guard situation), a rotational RB and kick returner, and at least a couple rotational players there.\n\nThis draft topping off our FA has left this team pretty much completely transformed and I am super excited to see how they look when the season comes around. Our offense just looks fucking TERRIFYING now (was already good with Staff-daddy last year and we made steps to beef up the o-line and got a top-line RB to go with the new line) and our defense is completely transformed after last years shit-tastic season (LB has been MASSIVELY overhauled, CB should be improved, d-line will be healthier and younger).","43":"Never before has day 3 of the draft made me feel so sad.","44":"Im just excited to be here and glad to see Gettleman drafted well once more. We didnt need any wrs so why grab one. Well use fa or next year's draft","45":"I\u2019m not being a homer when I say this- the Packers draft was by far one of the worst drafts ever. The only good pick all day to fill major needs was when they drafted Martin from the U of MN. \n\nLegitimate D grade for the entire draft.\n\nI\u2019m going to send their GM a fruit basket","46":"Small businesses around the country going out of business and ESPN will survive.","47":"It really seemed like the smaller school players got hurt the most this year.

It's 2020 and the coverage is still pretty crappy.","53":"Don't mind us, but Texans had a pretty good draft imo. We got a starter in Ross Blacklock and a high upside pass rusher in Greenard. Bolstered our OLine depth with a project RT\/swing tackle prospect. Along with other FA acquisitions, I'm cautiously optimistic about next season.","54":"No bias Ravens win.","55":"Surprised that Hunter Bryant wasn't drafted.","56":"No Goggles or Moss?

Press 2 if you wish it returned back to the way it was.\n\nI for 1 liked it better this time because it was much more funny. Seeing everyone at home chilling. Goodell not giving two shits at the end of the third round, just propping his feet up with no slippers on. Coaches letting dogs turn in their pick. Frozone.

Fuck!","95":"Missed out on Patmon but we got Gordon \nGO FUCKING COUGS","96":"I'm gonna give our draft a B+. We landed Tua at 5 which was massive. 2 DBs and 6 linemen is exactly what we need. Nobody is going to give us an A because outside of Tua there is no splashy big name guy, but when your team is 48% UDFA you have to fill needs and building the trenches and secondary was the perfect plan.","97":"[Spielman life](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/9qBRzu7.png)","98":"Tommy D managed to go an entire draft without trading away assets or making picks I strongly disagree with.

A+ grade. unbiased winners of the draft. no competition","102":"I thought the Eagles absolutely killed Day 3. They got several guys that need coaching to harness their physical talent, so high-upside but raw. \n\nWanogho has 3-4th talent, just got screwed by the timing of the injury and covid-19. I think Wallace was way underrated by the gurus and has a chance to start immediately. They got more than one guy that can take the top off a defense, which they desperately missed after DJax went down; even with their limitations, that speed opens up so much for Ertz and Dallas.","103":"Idk who needs to hear this but most of the \u201csteals\u201d in the later rounds won\u2019t make the team.","104":"Will this be the most analyzed NFL draft in the history of ESPN?

Imagine what the back of the jerseys would look like.","193":"It\u2019s just so weird. I understand the theory behind the pick, if you think the guy is the future of the franchise, you take him. But by the time Rodgers is retired, Love is  at the end of his rookie contract and you have no idea if it\u2019s worth going forward with him. It completely defeats the purpose of having a potential franchise qb on the rookie deal.","194":"Have you found any Packers fans who like the Jordan Love pick?","195":"I was definitely confused at first but now that I've seen the entire draft pan out, [this is how I feel about our picks](https:\/\/youtu.be\/86jbnMOAcy0?t=18).","196":"Aaron should for sure ask for a trade.

I think it's too early to judge that pick. I think he can produce enough gadget offense if used right while also still playing the role of a backup quarterback. Philly fans may regret hating on the pick so bad. But also I could be wrong, who knows? It's just early imo.","244":"Your QB is a fragile China doll.

It's a very important position.","252":"Apparently they were interested in the top WR prospects, they just couldn't trade up high enough.","253":"It's kind of sad how his whole career they've treated him like \"just a starting QB.\" Like he's just a piece of the puzzle they have filled.

Wtf are the Packers thinking with that draft though? You\u2019ve hopefully got two more elite years of Rodgers and throw in the towel on competing?","392":"Not when you have other needs.

The Saints and Bucc's are going totally win now, so are the Colts. The Packers were way too good and had way too few draft value to make a good rebuild work. Also planning for a future after Rodgers, it might not work because even 3 years is too long in the future to know how to draft for it now.","427":"So you're jealous, got it.","428":"I guess I'm getting old as I have no idea who the fuck you are talking about","429":"It\u2019s crazy what acting like a human does for your image","430":"Oh yeah the Giants did well. We shall see how our teams fare this season.","431":"I was ecstatic when you guys drafted Andrew Thomas because he's a really good football player at a position of need. Smart pick. Also it meant we got Tua.","432":"But even that doesn't make sense.  There are two realistic scenario's (assuming Rodgers doesn't pull a Gronk or something and threaten to retire if they trade him or something)\n\nScenario 1) He's still good and you're trading away a really good quarterback who makes you a contender.  Trading him here only makes sense if you think Love is Mahomes' like otherwise it makes you worse in the short term, which would be bad considering you're a title contender\n\nScenario 2) If he's bad, you've got an old as hell bad quarterback making a ton of money.  What kind of return is that gonna get you?","433":"No, the dead cap money means he is all but guaranteed for two years. In 2 years the dead cap is $17M, in 3 years it's $2M.","434":"And then to not add any receivers to help both QBs out","435":"This right here. We are one Rodgers injury away from a fruitless season. The rest of our picks... Wtf are we doing? They couldn't give us one single WR? Seems like a slap in the face","436":"Can confirm. The Love pick looks almost reasonable compared to the second and third rounds.","437":"Always thought that segment was BS but nope, it's how he thinks.","438":"I'm actually very happy about our draft tbh","439":"I also don't really like the Chargers draft, mainly because I disagree with their first round. I don't think Herbert will be good, especially behind that line, and trading picks to move up for Kenneth Murray is a questionable more. I love Murray the guy but I don't think he was worth trading back up for","440":"That\u2019s fair. \n\nI guess I wasn\u2019t sold on the idea of taking another RB at all. But given all our Maryland connections I believe they know him pretty well.","441":"That's it. No more college eligibility. Better hope a team signs you as a UDFA and go from there","442":"It seems pretty reasonable given that the last highly touted WR prospect was drafted right before they went on the clock.\n\nAlso the Rodgers versus Management manufactured storyline is beyond tired at this point.  Some of us just want to talk football, not create drama.","443":"He has to stay on the yacht all season long for luck, thems the rules","444":"https:\/\/media.giphy.com\/media\/rwGYNSgMjEymQ\/giphy.gif","445":"Maybe not, but all you can ask from a draft is to hit on good players.

He has said that he had an opportunity to be drafted but told teams he wouldn't sign a 2 way contract. He went undrafted and signed a one year deal with Golden State.","456":"Van Vleet did it. if you're a late 2nd you get stuck with a D League 2 way contract for 2-3 years where you might not see the NBA. So he went undrafted, played in the summer league, and waited for a team to give him NBA playing time.","457":"It happened with Alonzo Trier and the Knicks.","458":"Lol I didn't even realize he like the Huskies. I don't really follow draft stuff besides watching the combine and the draft lol. I guess after doing something like he does for a while you probably start developing biases to certain teams or coaches","459":"I haven't followed any UDFA's yet, but that would be a good landing spot (home games in a dome).","460":"I mean I could run the bases and used Ken Griffey Jr\u2019s stance, but that\u2019s it lol","461":"*And* getting rid of DJ's contract...","462":"Just keep running the ball? No way that would work in a nfccg","463":"Makes sense, not everyone can be a Quarterback factory like Philadelphia, it's time for the Packers to pound the rock like it's 1940!","464":"Lost a few and injuries","465":"It's really hard to know who's going to win until the season is underway. We don't know how or if the Packers will address WR through FA. The Saints, Bucs, and Colts could do great this upcoming season, they could also miss the playoffs. \n\nI'm not happy with the trade up for Love (I'd be okay with it if it wasn't traded up but I still would have preferred a WR), but we addressed OL, and we have to have something planned for WR unless we're literally just going to ignore it.","466":"Saints and Buccs didn't get a new coach and aren't changing their offense.","467":">acting human\n\nNot sure if that'd describe Goodell here. I always thought conspiracies about lizard people were nonsense, now I'm not sure","468":"Or you trade the backup.","469":"The Seahawks are one Wilson injury away from a wasted season, the Bucc's are a Tom Brady injury away from a wasted \"super team\", possible damaging the whole team again for multiple seasons, and the bears are one injury to Trubisky away from the playoffs.","470":"Yeah out of all the picks y'all made, the Love pick started to look like the best one. There's a chance he turns into a franchise QB. Great arm talent, touch, and anticipation on throws. If he can figure out coverages and take care of the ball, he will be good. But Rodgers still has good years left and is owed a ton of money. After that idk what y'all were doing. No receivers is unforgivable and if the o-line picks bust, this draft was awful for y'all","471":"Honestly I love Gruden.  He's not a bad coach by any means but damn is he entertaining.  He fits the Raiders well too.","472":"Yeah the Hurts pick still has me spinning, but the rest of our draft went almost perfect.","473":"We probably need another one. Conner has enough injury concerns that we can justify it","474":"It's not Rodgers versus Management, it's about the influence Rogers has within the management and coaching structure and the future of the team's offensive style.  For example, Peyton Manning had a tremendous amount of influence on Colts, and possible Broncos. Manning could bench players during a game or walk into the GMs office and get players traded or released. He had a lot of influence within the management.\n\n\nI think there is some truth for McCarthy and Rogers not getting along during the later years, but even so Rogers was frustrated with the direction of the offense recently and was probably thought he would have way more influence with the new coach and GM.  because fricking Arron Rogers one of the best QBs to play the game. How many times has he put the team on his back and carried them to wins?\n\nBut everything has changed, GB focused on defense recently and now the direction the team wants to take is not a high-flying offense. It looks like will be more hybrid with more runs and  check down passes. The message is, Rogers is getting older his style of play is not winning championships anymore consistently. Look at all the teams who have won the SB in the last 10 years... versatile teams that do many different things well, or defense focused teams. Even the 2015 SB winning Peyton Manning led Denver Broncos were more defensive focused team, with a mediocre offense (Yes I know Chiefs this year, but they lucked into a massively good QB on rookie contact, lets see what happens to the team when he commands his full worth, you'll see many of their weapons go into FA)     \n\nBelieve me or don't but truth is the type of football Rogers plays to is out of style. There is no place for him and his LARGE salary anymore with the Packers. And of course the GM cant come out and tell one of the most iconic Packer's players ever it, but the is clear message... Rogers' days in Green Bay are going to be pretty mediocre so maybe he should request a trade if wants to end his career playing the style of offense he is suited for.","475":"A weird position to win mvp would basically be the same?","476":"Ah ok. Couldn't tell through the text.","477":"A lot of people have been saying that though. He's not great but he certainly isn't bad","478":"Neaux...","479":">smdh\n\nUm.. what now? \n\nShaking my dick head? \n\nPlease tell me it ain't that.\n\nEdit: I may have made a grave mistake by asking.","480":"Is a seventh rounder really going to hold a significant and potentially career-ending grudge just for not abiding by his kooky scheme?","481":"That and a sob story will get you drafted lmao","482":"Stop.

In the bow game against USC they ran it multiple times in a row and it picked up a good chunk of yardage","1077":"That\u2019s because in college you get penalized for sacks as negative rushing yards. He\u2019s very good at sneaks.","1078":"Almost like sacks are considered negative runs in college...","1079":"Just not DJK","1080":"Ah, the old Kirkaroo","1081":"He's used to winning in Minnesota so it's a plus","1082":"Presumably being a QB taken in the 7th round means he's not great.","1083":"Not absolutely terrible, but not a pick I'd be excited about. He had some flashes of brilliance but at other times was aggravating to watch","1084":"As an Iowa fan, he has everything you'd want in a really good backup. He's super experienced, strong, hard to take down. Just don't expect finesse laden throws or great timing on deep throws from him.","1085":"He isn\u2019t terrible. He will be a solid backup.","1086":"If you need to somehow gain 30 yards using only QB sneaks, Stanley is absolutely your man.","1087":"Yes","1088":"Jt O'Sullivan put him ahead of Hurts and Herbert on his pre-draft QB big board","1089":"Yea. He\u2019s good if you like overthrown medium to deep balls.","1090":"Except that one game we don't talk about","1091":"Damn bro...throat slasher over here","1092":"You missed one important word: **legitimately**","1093":"I mean they start Kirk Cousins","1094":"That\u2019s projected 1st round QB Mitch Leidner to you, give him some respect","1095":"How could you forget about legendary Joel \"The Hammer\" Stave?","1096":"Why do you say that? Does he suck?","1097":"Yes, Reddit, the bastion of original humor.","1098":"Really? Source for that?","1099":"Not at all. Gordon was a turnover machine, especially in the red zone.

We started Stanley for three years and the same shit was happening week 1 year 1 as year 3 bowl game. He's got a fantastic QB sneak though.","1108":"WE SOMEWHAT DISLIKE IOWA","1109":"Lol that was hilarious. Great game","1110":"Oh ffs, just cut him now! Hahaha","1111":"But please god do not let him see the field","1112":"Yes. I\u2019m all for it","1113":"There are worse fates","1114":"Damn you. I had all but forgotten about that \"era.\"","1115":"Thankfully I never watched that game and I never will. I hope any YouTube footage gets the \u201cStar Wars Christmas special\u201d treatment","1116":"You boomed him","1117":"I still laugh when I think about our first and goal against USC where we snuck it 3 times in a row. One of the highlights of last season for sure","1118":"The QB sneak that game was a thing of beauty. Linderbaum developed pretty well near the end of the season. Him, Jackson and Wirfs plowing through that D-line was beautiful.","1119":"I think he did right up until he found out he was running a makeshift drug ring lol.","1120":"D:","1121":"Ohhhhh my.","1122":"I like you.","1123":"floyd is coming home next year trust","1124":"Yep. But what you\u2019d expect in the 7th","1125":"He\u2019s actually pretty damn accurate when he puts the ball on a rope, but yeah any sort of touch pass and he\u2019s way off","1126":"Dude kills slants and button hooks \ud83e\udd74","1127":"Not that Im disagreeing with you but its kinda funny every QB thread past the 3rd round has basically echoed the same sentiment \"he will be a solid backp\". With how few QB spots there are in the NFL, odds are most of these guys dont pan out into even solid backups","1128":"Jt O'Sullivan is wrong. Stanley's best attribute is he 'looks like a quarterback'","1129":"If he can get his interceptions under control he will be solid. 27-12 record. He is nothing special but some of the reactions are a little hyperbolic.","1130":"3 years as a starter and he never finished with a completion percentage of 60%. Its not like Iowa runs a particularly demanding offense either. Biggest upside is his measurable and \"game management\" if you believe that trait.","1131":"As a PSU fan who watches quite a bit of big ten I\u2019d say so. He\u2019s got the prototypical height, arm strength but production isn\u2019t there","1132":"Nvm I remembered wrong:\n\n>Against Utah, he threw directly to multiple stationary defenders, and against Washington, he dropped back 70 times and completed only three passes 10-plus yards downfield.\u201d\n\nhttps:\/\/247sports.com\/LongFormArticle\/NFL-Draft-2020-top-10-quarterback-prospects-ranked-PFF-Tua-Tagovailoa-Joe-Burrow-Jalen-Hurts-143269986\/","1133":"Choking leads I blame more on Leach than Gordon","1134":"You cant blame choking a 35 pt lead on the quarterback that threw for 9 touchdowns in 1 game. Get the hell outta here","1135":"That might be it lol.","1136":"As an Iowa fan I put that more on the coaches. When your starter is doing the same shit his 1st year as year 3 that\u2019s coaches fault. Either get him to stop or develop\/play another QB.","1137":"What if he\u2019s in victory formation and just kneeling?","1138":"We lose to a hail Mary in the super bowl?","1139":"That was the most goddamn Kirk Ferentz flex and I loved it","1140":"I think pretty much everyone hates DJK now, when he went on a tirade a while back there was a LOT of former players that came out and said that he was basically a colossal asshole and was lying through his teeth","1141":"well yea but we are taking it back home with us once we beat ya'll yet again","1142":"If you're looking for a QB to run sneaks though, he's your man","1143":"Considering the Vikings QB situation I feel pretty alright saying he will be a solid backup. Most teams have 3 QB\u2019s on the roster so it\u2019s usually a safe bet that a bunch of the QB\u2019s drafted in the later rounds will be a solid backup for a couple years.","1144":"Considering how inaccurate he is I feel like he should have had more picks. Dude throws the ball so hard nobody can catch it I guess.","1145":"I was about to say, Mike Leach doesn't call a lot of deep shots, but that seemed unbelievable.","1146":"Conveniently leaving out the 3 turnovers. Especially the fumble on the last drive","1147":"Manion is apparently very intelligent, so it is good for Kirk to talk to him after offense exits the field.","1148":"Im not a Brian fan by any means. But I think if we could have recruited anyone who could shake things up we'd have plugged em in. Just couldn't get it done against the big dogs last two years.\n\nHopefully this week's draft being so full of Hawks will help the future.","1149":"Okay, one exception","1150":"\"How to run a trap house and blame it on Kirk Ferentz\" - DJK\n\nHe supposedly had a \"tell all\" book he was writing, I assumed it would have something like this as the title.","1151":"\ud83d\ude10 doubt that but ok Iowa is definitely losing more than us this offseason","1152":"Somehow averaged like 5-7 yards per sneak. It was absolutely incredible, when Kirk ran 3 consecutive sneaks from the 10 yard line against USC I came in my pants","1153":"He's just likes to hold the ball. He misses open short receivers. When he can get the ball out without pressure he's solid. And his deep balls are dimes.","1154":"That's fine hire him as a QB coach then. We need a backup who can actually play quarterback.","1155":"Lmao you guys had one season.","1156":"Dude Iowa ALWAYS has a bunch studs in their trenches.","1157":"Bro you did not watch Nate Stanley. His deep ball is not accurate whatsoever. His deep ball is the worst part of his game. He single handedly lost us the game against Penn State because he cannot throw it well. I would recommend doing some research on a player before commenting on him.","1158":"....which was last season and we have a lot of people from that season coming back","1159":"So is nobody gonna draft moss?

I thought 5:30 PM might be a bit early for bed.","1242":"I doubt you'd be brazen enough to do what our actual GM did in the first three rounds though.

Only 3 of those 9 were taken after the 2nd round (Scary Terry (3rd), Hunter Renfrow (5th), and Darius Slayton (5th). In fact 17 of those 28 receivers posted less than 200 yards last year, including 4\/9 WRs taken in the first two rounds.\n\nOf the 33 WRs taken in the 2018 draft (looking at their 2018+2019 stats), 25 have posted less than 700 yards total in their career so far.

It is very doubtful than many, if any, WRs taken today will end up definitively better than who we have right now. Many taken in the first three will also bust.","1244":"Probably better than BB using that 2nd on a DB","1245":"The One Where AB Has A Fist Fight With ARod.","1246":"Megatron isn't, like, *retired* retired, right?","1247":"What about Megatron, he's only 34.","1248":"And Funchess was good when he had a good QB.","1249":"Oh, meant Funchess not Dorsett","1250":"Sounds good to me.

The only reason he lost the starting job is because Elgton Jenkins is a stud. \n\nCurtis Samuel is going into the final year of his rookie deal, so if we trade for him we\u2019ll either have to pay him or only have him for one year, so I doubt he\u2019s worth more than a 3rd rounder, especially considering he hasn\u2019t had elite production. That\u2019s not his fault and it was painful to watch Kyle Allen miss him when he got open deep over and over again, but it should keep his trade value lower. \n\nYou guys signed Robby Anderson and have DJ Moore and a couple other decent WRs, so IMO shopping Samuel for a starting-caliber guard and mid round pick is well worth it.","1256":"Because you\u2019re not gonna get much more for an average WR","1257":"No the bears are paying him eight million lmao","1258":"Nope, he's on the Bears now","1259":"Personally I think he\u2019s a stud held back by shitty QBs","1260":"Then it's better to hold him lol, I swear teams always wanna give up minimal assets in trades.

Big boom\/bust potential is good for a team that\u2019s likely looking at a regime change next year. Might as well swing for the fences","2252":"I don't know about power back but he can catch the  ball and play across the field so definitely fits our offense.","2253":"Loved watching him here at ASU so stoked to be able to still watch him live.","2254":"How I felt about Aiyuk","2255":"Well yes, but actually no.\n\n5th round really,  what we traded Drake for.","2256":"The numbers weren't there, but every good drive that ASU put together had him behind it.\n\nLast year he had a lot of those Barry Sanders 5 yard run highlights. 4 or 5 jukes, but eventually the 6th unblocked guy got him.","2257":"Did you see him at ASU?","2258":"Cowboys Cardinals NFC championship?","2259":"We also got Jalen Thompson for a 5th rounder whos expected to be a starting safety next season. Depending where Simmons will line up (I expect MLB but who knows)","2260":"Our round 5 pick was Jalen Thompson and Kenyan Drake was our round 6 pick.","2261":"Eno was so good last year but didn't get much of any blocking last year. Drafted 3 rounds after ballage, who was way worse of a player while here","2262":"Even crazier how every team managed to pick one of them in the 7th round, too","2263":"Because running backs are low value. Late day 3 is where you might as well give some of the non-elite guys a shot\n\nIf this was even five years ago, he gets drafted a lot higher","2264":"If he came out after his sophomore year he would've been a 3rd rounder probably, he was really good.\n\nThis last year his line was really bad and we had freshman QB so he saw more stacked boxes. Didn't really get to show as much.\n\nHe's not an amazing RB but he's pretty solid","2265":"Heandre Dopkins","2266":"Must be a great feeling that you know you'll be a day 1 fan favorite heading into camp.","2267":"I thought that guy was just in the trade to offset salaries?","2268":"I\u2019m gonna take the bait\n\n\nIt\u2019s the same regime","2269":"I mean he was supposed to be a 4th or 5th rounder so it's insane that he fell so far","2270":"UA alum, great pick for the cards","2271":"I\u2019m not the gm I\u2019ve wanted him since round 4","2272":"Like actually who tf is Tyler Davis and we could\u2019ve just signed him after the draft","2273":"Really hope he doesnt get pushed down the depth chart. He looks to be the 3rd string back, hopefully he can become a committee back with Drake","2274":"Since he broke out in 2018, yes.","2275":"There\u2019s no way Simmons is taking Thompsons\u2019s FS spot.\n\nNot that Thompson was great as the center fielder last season or anything, but that\u2019s not Simmons\u2019s spot at all. He\u2019s a box\/nickel safety who can play some nickel LB too","2276":">Depending where Simmons will line up (I expect MLB but who knows)\n\nHe'll play wherever he's needed lol.\n\nAside from the obvious, I personally want to see him with some OLB snaps. Dude had the highest pass rush success rate in the country last year and is super disruptive on tape","2277":"Ballage is big and runs fast in a straight line. Benjamin does not have those qualities at all, but has just about everything else.\n\nI wish he came back to ASU. He's a fun player to watch. He'll push Chase Edmonds for change of pace duties.","2278":"I\u2019m starting to think that players being drafted into the NFL were good in college.\n\nIdk though.","2279":"What's weird is they seem to be low value as veterans....I'd think rooking contract RB's would be very high value because of that but maybe i'm thinking about it wrong.","2280":"Why do people keep butchering his name? Smh it\u2019s Leandre Smopkins.","2281":"HDop.","2282":"Yeah that\u2019s it!","2283":"That\u2019s really close to Dropkins, I can\u2019t imagine that he pans out.","2284":"Cardinals are stringing him along. Just cut him already so he can compete for a spot in training camp somewhere.","2285":"Only if you believe that the new coach doesn\u2019t have a shitload of say in who they draft. It\u2019s the same GM, but that\u2019s not the same as a whole regime.","2286":"I was watching the draft all day and from the middle of round 4 I was nervously waiting for the Cards to pick him. Jags were one of the teams I tight would take him before we could in the 6th. And then we passed him again.\n\nRoller coaster of a draft for him.","2287":"With running back by committee being more popular I\u2019d assume he will get some carries. Maybe he can cement himself as a safety valve for Murray like he kinda was for Jalen.","2288":"I remember one run where he juked the shit out of someone and the whole crowd reacted to it. Good times.","2289":"I think he'll definitely play there in place of Kennard on some 3rd downs","2290":"The issue stems from the idea that there\u2019s a disconnect between HB talent and HB production. You don\u2019t need a highly talented HB to produce a very good running game, and not only that but there\u2019s an argument to be made that HB production is more reliant on scheme and blocking than actual HB talent, since success seems to correlate with opposing men in the box pretty firmly\n\nIn other words, a creative coach with solid talent can produce a running game just as effective if not more so than a running game built around a star HB, so that alone hurts the individual HB\u2019s inherent value\n\nThis is then compounded by the fact that the running game is a less effective method of offensive production than the passing game, which automatically makes it less important than both the passing offense and passing defense in terms of roster construction\n\nSo you\u2019re talking about a position which is easily replaceable for a job that isn\u2019t as important, and because of that spending high value assets (whether cap space or high draft picks) isn\u2019t really the best idea","2291":"Andy Thompson","2292":"More like HDrop, I've heard he's solid but has shaky hands","2293":"He plays a lot like Chase Edmonds. If Benjamin can pass block, I think there will be a rotation between the 3 with Drake getting just a little more than half the work.","2294":"His 2018 was really, really fun","2295":"Can you be a little more specific?","2296":"Yeah I know enough about football currently that your explantation makes more sense. I think they will adapt and adjust but yeah, it's like diminishing returns to have a \"special\" rb to get you a little more production when the lower guys can supposedly get you good enough for pennies","2297":"furthermore, eno is acknowledged to be very much a product of the spread offense. which maybe only the cards sort of run in the NFL","2298":"Probably why Houston got rid of him as fast as they could.","2299":"I liked 2018 no fumble Eno so much. Getting him here makes it great for him to learn and touch up on some things.","2300":"Bowl game vs Fresno State its his first TD run.","2301":"Not a SINGLE player on offense. I'm about it.","2302":"That's not a real name","2303":"Matt Rhule the absolute mad lad has done it.","2304":"That's 2.75 first names.","2305":"Oliveriiiiiiiiii","2306":"All Defense Draft","2307":"Wild name","2308":"THEY DID IT! First time in the common draft era that a team went all defense in a draft. Pretty awesome","2309":"Are you saying Stantley? Like sheep's wool?","2310":"A Panther goes to the Panthers!","2311":"His last name is literally Tommy Oliver, so he must be known as a power ranger for the rest of his career.","2312":"I mean other than OL y'all got a solid offense on paper so I don't blame the strategy.","2313":"Definitely a good strategy. Offense is already solid and having a good defense will maximize your success since Teddy will most likely just be a game manager","2314":"I mean... look who you have in your division now. Y'all already had to deal with Drew Brees and all the weapons he has around him. Now you've got to deal with the GOAT along with Gronk. I think this makes perfect sense.","2315":"We're not playing offense this year. Safeties and defensive TDs only.","2316":"His parents didn\u2019t want him to have three first names.","2317":"Hes the third!","2318":"And the one that's .75 is his first name","2319":"Panther king","2320":"Exactly. Skill positions are covered and we\u2019re committed to Okung for better or for worse. This was the way.","2321":"Would have liked a C prospect but I guess there just wasn't any up to snuff on the board.","2322":"The reason we only picked defense is because our offense is fine and we lost most of our defensive starters. The offense is still going to be better than the defense","2323":"It\u2018s the III that makes this for me.","2324":"Undrafted?","2325":"I'm not complaining. This draft could set our defense up for years.","2326":"Would def be happy if they looked at a guy.\n\nLess about Paradis's play and more he's not gonna be here long-term so some moves to set up depth on the interior line would be kinda good to do.

I just don't see how he fell so far.","2388":"Guys probably didn\u2019t think he would fall and had their \u2018guy\u2019 at receiver since there\u2019s so many they likely didn\u2019t see much of a difference","2389":"Was a beast at osu.","2390":"His measurables aren\u2019t great but he\u2019s a damn baller","2391":"Was it worth it... maybe","2392":"Except the chargers of course","2393":"AGAINST ALL ODDS","2394":"r\/nfl got their guy","2395":"It's obvious Funchess was our WR pick.","2396":"The fact that he fell as far as he did, yet they still didn't bother to take a receiver at all? Fucking hell","2397":"Don\u2019t worry, we don\u2019t know what a WR this draft is either lol.","2398":"KJ had a pretty bad combine.  (It\u2019s still inexcusable to be this late and behind Metellus lol) Pair that with very average height and measurables.  There was nothing jumping off the page with him.  He was just \u2018ok\u2019 all around the board (at least on paper).  \n\nHe was a very good college player.  Now he had a chance to prove he wasn\u2019t just good because he had Day drawing up plays for him and a pair of top 15 picks (Dwayne and Fields) throwing it to him.","2399":"Neither do I.

Trust me.","2422":"God I hate him even more now","2423":"Imagine Minoru Suzuki wearing a cheesehead","2424":"Hahaha","2425":"I know it was. He wasn't as good this past year but I think some of it has to do with the difference between Haskins and Fields along with the emergence of Chris Olave. He was still great in 2018 and being around a WR like Keenan Allen should help him a lot","2426":"You have to admit you are also curious why he fell so far, even if its in meme form","2427":"rather have that then what I mentioned","2428":"Tip over the M&M bowl next year so Goodell can reveal his true lizard self and tongue some M&Ms into his mouth.","2429":"I\u2019d love to see an NFL team counter the speed over size strategy NFL defenses are taking and try to implement a triple-option offense with behemoth players, 6-7 340lbs lineman, 6\u2019 265 lb fb, 6\u2019 220lbs running backs and then a prime cam Newtown at QB or like Josh Allen.","2430":"DDT getting ideas...","2431":"Fuck.

Felt like Iowa\u2019s rock on defense last year on a top defense.","2438":"I'm biased as a Hawkeyes fan, but I think he's a potential steal. Was a tremendous player for Iowa. Very hard worker who plays with a chip on his shoulder and plays faster than how he tested at the combine, imo.","2439":"That's kinda a dope picture he's got","2440":"Dudes a beast.

He was out of position sometimes and overcommitted to playing the ball a lot and gave up huge plays sometimes because of it but he got a lot better every year. Was a pretty good tackler and played a LOT better closer to the LOS, total ballhawk when he didn't overcommit and mistake the pass trajectory. Always liked him even though he was a bit rough around the edges.","2459":"He is a hard-hitting, ball-hawking safety. Perfect for Baltimore.","2460":"He will. He\u2019s got great value for how late he is","2461":"Or Geno Smith","2462":"Even if Stone wasn't better (which he is), I can't imagine picking a player with the exact same name as your star.

Gave away a 5th next year for another 7th this year, plus moved up some spots this round.\n\nEdit: per Ravens Twitter \u201cWe traded 2020 pick 225 and 2021 5th round pick from Pittsburgh, for the Vikings 2020 picks 201 and 219.\u201d","2468":"Not entirely sure but seems like he has less then ideal measurables. 5'10 207 and a 4.66 is pretty bad for a DB. But PFF wrote about him as comparable to Delpit so I'm not complaining.","2469":"No athleticism, amazing instincts according to PFF","2470":"Safety is a tough spot to make our roster right now. We\u2019ve got Clark and ET plus Levine as licks and Elliott is probably a lock too.

We got a 6th this year and moved up in the 7th. Not 2 7ths.","2476":"Roster expands under the new CBA so I expect they\u2019ll have room for him","2477":"That makes sense.

We kept all our guys from last year and all the starters have been good, so I don't see the need for drafting a DB this year when there were bigger needs replacing our lost players at other positions like OL, DL, WR, and backup TE.","2579":"Hurd will not pan out these are fundamentally different people.","2580":"You will get a LS, P or K and you will like it.","2581":"And ... he's gone!","2582":"6-7th round picks isn't going to do much for any position.\n\nI have full confidence in Shanny + Lynch at any rate.","2583":"We are gonna go heavy in UDFA in DBs. Get another E-Man","2584":"We have more or less as many DBs as WRs.  We are deep and varied in both groups.  The only type of pick that made sense for the secondary was if you were going to go high end, and start replacing Sherman or just flat go BPA for talent.  But at this point people are kidding themselves that some sort of 6th or 7th round DB pick changes fortunes greatly there...  \n\nEman, sherm, spoon, k'waun, Reed, Moore, ward, Harris, whatever the fuck we pick up in udfa market or during the season--we are 100% a super bowl secondary.","2585":"JJ is a fucking beast. He carried Tennessee for literally years. Any time they needed a big play it went to him and he made it. Go watch his highlights. I\u2019m so stoked he\u2019s a 9er","2586":"Someone tell me what makes Hill such a gem","2587":"The most accurate comment has the perfect attitude and drive.","2588":"CAUGHT. CAUGHT.

High\n\nI actually played with Jauan in peewee football for the Cowan Lions hahaha","2595":"I haven\u2019t heard of him.","2596":"Hurd never went to Blackman. Itavius did though.","2597":"I heard he used to be a quarterback and looks like a running back. You\u2019re only allowed on the team as a 6 foot receiver IF you used to play another position....and went to Tennessee, I think.","2598":"He\u2019s def gonna be used as a TE","2599":"Him or hunter Bryant and I\u2019ll buy the next 5 people gold who respond","2600":"Whelp","2601":"Slow down there","2602":"Trenches make DB's look good.\n\nOur secondary looked so much better this past season when they didn't have to cover dudes for 7+ seconds.","2603":"Worked well last year up until the superbowl so hey, let's see what happens. Watching Jennings highlights now and he looks good so I'm gonna trust the front office","2604":"Watching some highlights of this Jennings guy now and tbf to Lynch he looks pretty great for a 7th rounder. Presume they'll dip into the UDFAs flr DBs, they might know something we don't","2605":"Definitely a better option at WR\/RB than this dude anyway. Shanny could even have him throw a bit, Edelman or Sanu style","2606":"Well yeah I do too but it's still worth taking a chance on guys. It rarely pans out but sometimes it does.","2607":"I hope so. Guess they're banking on guys wanting to go to contenders. Doesn't hurt to guarantee the good DBs by actually drafting them tho.","2608":"JJ was literally the only reason I watched UT football the past several years.","2609":"He played at Ohio State !!1!","2610":"What a great memory. My senior year and the only time I visited Georgia's stadium. An unreal moment for sure.","2611":"What's better than two QBs?\n\n*Three QBs*","2612":"As it is written, so it shall be done","2613":"I had the hardest high five of my life that day. Hand was still red and sore like 30 minutes after, so worth it","2614":"Wrong HS, my bad. Apparently we beat y'all by 15 though that year. I was thinking of the Border Wars thing where Blackman and Christ Presbyterian came.","2615":"Definitely more of a TE kinda guy. He's a monster on the field and the king of broken tackles.","2616":"Sure you will","2617":"Surprised at some people being on the board still.","2618":"Bet.","2619":"hey","2620":"Yessir","2621":"Who would be better?","2622":"I totally agree because a great dline does wonders for DBs. We have seen past seasons where there was no pass rush and our DBs got gassed and beat, and I think they want to avoid that.","2623":"Once again, we'd like to thank [sportsreference.com](https:\/\/www.sports-reference.com\/) for helping out with college stats for our draft cards.

Hanson is one of the reasons why Oregon had one of the best o-lines in the country. Didn\u2019t allow a single sack his first three seasons.

As long as Hanson can fix those Hands issues, he\u2019ll do wonders protecting Rodgers.","3116":"But we don't need a WR1, we need a compliment to Adams, and Funchess is better than Lazard, MVS, or Allison.","3117":"But he played like a WR2, which is what we need. He is absolutely better than any of our WR2 options last year.","3118":"in 2017 though Funchess was WR1 right?","3119":"Ceedee Lamb *WAS* the WR1 on Oklahoma.\n\nJustin Jefferson *WAS* the WR1 on LSU.\n\nJalen Raegor *WAS* the WR1 on TCU.\n\nBrandon Aiyuk *WAS* the WR1 on Arizona State.\n\nTee Higgins *WAS* the WR1 on Clemson.","3120":"If Thielen gets hurt the Vikings are bottom 5. Whats your point? Almost every team would be bottom 5 if they lost their top WR.\n\nWhat a dumb fucking argument lmao","3121":"Funchess is a WR, and we did sign him in FA, and he is on the roster this year","3122":"Yeah Funchess is a solid WR2.","3123":"Yeah but he wasn\u2019t very good, it was more they just didn\u2019t have any receivers","3124":"Yep. They\u2019re young and *ARE* ready to play. \n\n\nJerry Rice and Funchess *WERE* ready to start in the league\n\nActually, Rice could probably still play.","3125":"But the Vikings addressed the lack of depth behind Thielen with a first round pick, that\u2019s kind of the point","3126":"Probably not. Especially if the first pick is day 1 ready. And our wr3 and 4 have potential as well. Plus Kyle Rudolph. Bottom half, but not bottom 5 like the packers. And no, not almost every team. If every team lost their WR1 packers would still be bottom 5. Least bottom 10.","3127":"Ok and we have Adams, who is a top 10 WR at a minimum, and also Aaron Jones who was great catching balls out of the backfield. He doesn't need to be the centerpiece at all, just good enough to be the third option on this offense.","3128":"Who is more likely to start, Funchess who has had moderate success in the NFL, or these rookie WRs who have had 0 success in the NFL?","3129":"The Packers addressed the lack of depth behind Adams with a FA signing, that's kind of the point","3130":"LMFAO, if you are relying on a rookie WR to be a WR1, and 2 guys who \"have potential\", that will absolutely be a bottom 5 group.","3131":"A rookie, obviously. Every rookie drafted this year is better than Funchess","3132":"Come on, don\u2019t do this. I\u2019m not even shitting on the Packers here, I even like Lazard\u2019s upside, but addressing the wide receiver position with Funchess is nowhere near addressing it with Jefferson.","3133":"We shall see. But they have more depth than the packers. I know it\u2019s your team, but you are thinking a lot more emotionally and with more of a bias than I am. I didn\u2019t say the Vikings are stacked, but they undoubtedly have more depth in that position.","3134":"God I hope you are being sarcastic....","3135":"Remember the last time the Vikings drafter a 1st round WR? A 1st round rookie is more likely to bust than a Veteren FA siging.","3136":"The only difference between the Vikings WRs and the Packers WRs is the the Vikings have a rookie WR2 that could possibly become very good, and the Packers have a Veteran WR2 that we know is decent but won't ever be more that average. Our WR is much more stable than yours. Did you forget Treadwell already? What if your rookie becomes Laquon 2.0?","3137":"Why do you think Funchess is worth a roster spot?","3138":"Jefferson *could* bust, Funchess *has* busted. I don\u2019t know how you can with a straight face make this argument. There\u2019s a reason you didn\u2019t have to trade a first round pick to get Funchess in the building.","3139":"No, I haven\u2019t forgot treadwell. Knew you\u2019d go there with the easy jab. It would be impressive to reproduce that much of a dumpster fire. But that argument means literally nothing because it\u2019s possible for any drafted player, college talent doesn\u2019t always translate to nfl talent. What if love turns out to be complete dog shit and you wasted a first pick when you still have a HOF QB with 4-5 years left? See pointless what if shit. You\u2019re probably just frustrated about the draft, like every other packers fan. You and me both know you\u2019d trade our core for your core in that position. So would the packers if they could, so would anyone. I\u2019d be frustrated too if my team was throwing away the last couple years of a HOF QB. Maybe they have some trades up their sleeves, if not, big yikes.","3140":"good lord dude","3141":"Yeah, the reason is that a 1st round pick is much cheaper and gives more team control. And Funchess is better than a lot of WRs drafted in the past 5 years. Most of them aren't even in the NFL anymore.\n\nhttps:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2015_NFL_Draft\n\nLook at his draft class, he is better than over half of the guys drafted above him","3142":"Yikes where do I even start.\n\n> It would be impressive to reproduce that much of a dumpster fire.\n\nNo it wouldn't it literally happens every year in the 1st round. John Ross? Corey Coleman? Josh Doctson? Kevin White?\n\n> What if love turns out to be complete dog shit and you wasted a first pick when you still have a HOF QB with 4-5 years left?\n\nWhat if he takes over for Rodgers in 3-4 years and lights it up, and turns out to be a consistent top 5 QB? What if we continue making the playoffs nearly every year and win a title with Rodgers?\n\n> You\u2019re probably just frustrated about the draft, like every other packers fan.\n\nNo, anyone who has been actually paying attention to what Gutekunst and LaFleur have been saying this offseason saw this coming. They got the shit kicked out of themselves twice by San Fran, and Lafleur wants his offense to look like theirs. Power Run, with a stable of RBs, which is what they have been drafting for. And Gutekunst had hinted they were looking at drafting a QB high the entire offseason.\n\n> You and me both know you\u2019d trade our core for your core in that position.\n\nAbsolutely, but thats only because a rookie is more valuable based on his contract. But in terms of talent for this upcoming season its basically identical, and thats only if Jefferson has at least an average rookie season.\n\n> I\u2019d be frustrated too if my team was throwing away the last couple years of a HOF QB.\n\nI don't define success as SB wins, so we probably differ here. Rodgers career has been incredibly successful going to the playoffs 9 times in 12 years, including 10 playoff wins. And judging by our returning talent I don't see us missing the playoffs this year either.","3143":"Show me evidence","3144":"Okay fine have fun with Funchess and keep assuming this year\u2019s WR crop is the 2015 group. \n\nFunchess won\u2019t beat out Lazard. Book it.","3145":"You make some good points, and I\u2019m sure you have a better understanding than me of the packers. But a few things with that said, you agreed you\u2019d trade your teams core for my teams core, and that was kinda originally the whole point of what go us into this \u201cargument\u201d I put it in quotes because I don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s a heated debate, we just have some different opinions. And I don\u2019t define the only way to be successful in SB wins either, lol I\u2019m a Vikings fan I\u2019d probably have quit by now if I did. I\u2019m happy having the 6th best win % in the league. But we all obviously want to get to the promise land, it\u2019s the ultimate goal no matter what. I feel like I can understand packers fans disappointment. Because if I had a guy like Rodgers I would find it very disheartening if my team wasn\u2019t pushing as hard as possible to get one more ring under them, especially after a 13-3 year. I don\u2019t understand why you wouldn\u2019t have a win now mentality, my packer friend doesn\u2019t, and plenty of packers fan I\u2019ve seen in here don\u2019t either. I would be heartbroken right now if my team pulled that on a HOF qb that did so much for my organization.","3146":"https:\/\/www.pro-football-reference.com\/players\/F\/FuncDe00.htm\n\nhttps:\/\/www.pro-football-reference.com\/players\/K\/KirkCh01.htm\n\nIs Christian Kirk worth a roster spot?

Cutting Jimmy Graham was literally addition by subtraction, he was downright terrible the past 2 years.","3161":"regardless. He warranted coverage, opening holes for the running game. Those holes are gone now. No one will respect any WR or TE on the team except Tae.","3162":"Sternberger looked better in the 2nd half of the season than Graham looked in his entire time with us. Jace will have a better season than Graham ever had on the Packers.","3163":"when did he look better?","3164":"When he came back off of IR and actually played. He was faster, and ran better routes than Graham. And he was a much better blocker.","3165":"Beavs","3166":"KJ Hill joined ISIS apparently.","3167":"is this a good pick","3168":"It\u2019s been said before but he really is a steal","3169":"Finally. This is the steal of the draft. Hodgins has the best hands in the draft by far. Dude dominated at OSU. I've been waiting for someone to pick him for a while, glad it's the Bills cuz they're cool. If anyone can help Allen's accuracy it's Mr. Reliable Isaiah Hodgins.","3170":"We got tall boys now","3171":"Surprised he was picked this late.","3172":"Love this guy. Hopefully I get more Bills games on TV when football is next played.","3173":"Isaiah Hodgins is the most normal \u2018football name\u2019","3174":"Someone check on K.J. Hill","3175":"Steal of the draft.\n\n I'm not making a joke, I can't believe he fell past the 4th.","3176":"Fuck I wanted this guy.  Go Beavs","3177":"Hodgins fell hard. Probably on that poor 40 time on the combine than didn't get a real pro day to run again. Great pick by the bills. Probably a legit 3rd round or better talent in the late 6th.","3178":"Another big body at WR, which was a need if not for next season for the future.","3179":"Happy with the draft.. Thanks Mcbeane","3180":"I\u2019m going to assume he\u2019s a bad character guy since he listed Holmes and Watson as his favorite movie.","3181":"Now I can rest","3182":"Probably fell this far thanks to his favorite movie. Red flag city.","3183":"He\u2019s gonna ball out. Overlooked because pac12 and Beavers(coming from beaver fan).","3184":"Lazard 2.0","3185":"Steal","3186":"Now the Bills have 4 good receivers this is good depth and also good BPA.","3187":"Straight up steal.","3188":"How was Oregon State so bad with 4 NFL players on offense...","3189":"Holmes and Watson was a garbage movie","3190":"Why no cb? Wasn\u2019t Arnold still available?","3191":"Oregon State thriving in the 6th round","3192":"Lesgooooooooo","3193":"While he deserved to go before some of the other WRs that got drafted recently, Hodgins is better","3194":"Or he\u2019s just not that special \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","3195":"Yes","3196":"Absolutely.","3197":"He's a contested catch guy, but he's good at it. Who knows if it'll translate to the NFL, but if it does, he'll be a steal, worth the late-round dart throw.","3198":"It's fantastic. Y'all got one of the best WRs in this draft IMO. Dude deserved to go in the third round. He's a monster. Not too athletic but he's so skilled.","3199":"Yeah. He's got great hands and catch radius. Low floor but pretty high ceiling. Should make the roster","3200":"Imagine what you hoped Zay Jones would be","3201":"Had a first round grade on him. Absolute steal","3202":"I kind of wanted him for the birds to mix in with all the speed. But I guess were just gonna mix in more speed with the speed. That\u2019s fine too.","3203":"supposedly the nfl and networks were interested in getting us on more national games this year. so naturally we get a pandemic that could threaten the season.","3204":"They\u2019re not the same type of player at all, they have about 10\u201d of difference in height","3205":"At this point I won\u2019t be shocked if he\u2019s hoping to be a UDFA. Gets to pick his team and gets to his second contract a year sooner.","3206":"Yeah Hodgins is so fucking good","3207":"I wish we would have drafted him","3208":"Josh Jones will always be the steal of the draft he fell that far despite being the fifth best tackle.","3209":"Stop","3210":"It feels like everyone we have picked had a bad combine day","3211":"Sounds like a troll answer","3212":"Forgetting somebody?","3213":"The defense","3214":"Our offense wasn't the issue","3215":"They weren't that bad this year, almost \nmade a bowl.","3216":"Our offense was never the problem. We almost always put up points (ignore the Utah game). Our defense on the other hand could hardly tackle.","3217":"Their defense was atrocious","3218":"Who was the fourth? \n\n\n\nDefense was ass, besides hamilcar rashed Jr., Who was sport illustrated first team all American, and led the NCAA in TFLs and was second in sacks.","3219":"1.33 point differential, lost a few really close games. They're on the upswing!","3220":"Well we were literally a couple plays away from 7-5 so we weren't actually bad.","3221":"4? Luton, hodgins and Blake who\u2019s the 4th","3222":"In the opposite order it should have gone in but yeah lol.","3223":"Watch out NFL, soon it'll be the first round","3224":"You're not special! \ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd76","3225":"Good hands and big catch radius are two things Allen needs in his receivers.","3226":"this one had me dying looool","3227":"You may just be a bad grader.","3228":"It's more like RIP Duke Williams","3229":"Right, don\u2019t forget Ray-Ray.","3230":"Not wrong, had our close losses go e the other way we would have been like 9-3","3231":"I know but I never saw the hype with KJ Hill to have people be legitimately upset he isn\u2019t on their team.","3232":"Spoiler: I have a first round grade on all 255 picks","3233":"Did you not have 327 first round grades?","3234":"Lmao this killed me","3235":"6 combined points cost us 3 games iirc.","3236":"That Wazzu game kills me","3237":"Should have made a bowl.","3238":"Yeah we really should've gone 6-6 at least","3239":"He\u2019s not special like a future WR1, but I\u2019d take him over at least a dozen of the WRs taken today. He\u2019s one of the best route runners in this entire class and he\u2019s sure handed.\n\nWhoever gets him is getting a guy who can consistently get you 40-50 catches and 500-700 yards a year imo.","3240":"Not sure people are upset. He was extremely productive and set records at a school that has tough records to set, so it just seems weird he'd fall so far.","3241":"Infallible optimism.","3242":"Fuck Thaddeus Moss.\n\nAll my homies hate Thaddeus Moss.","3243":"We dont even have a picture for him lol","3244":"holy shit we had someone drafted go jackets","3245":"RIP Thaddeus Moss and Hunter Bryant","3246":"Hunter Bryant must\u2019ve died I guess","3247":"Thad Moss mustve killed someone","3248":"Starting to feel that Thadd Moss should've gone back for his Senior year. In a way, I thought last name recognition and being associated with Burrow would carry some more weight, but it's clear he's seen as a primarily blocking Tight End.","3249":"If we're gonna go TE... why not Hunter Bryant?","3250":"Wingo was really trying not to say Penis","3251":"Moss and Bryant really getting no love huh. Odd.","3252":"Oof, not having a picture","3253":"So as a CU and GT fan, with the Jags now having Shenault and Davis, I may have to vaguely support them?","3254":"Bout to cut my own hair, wish me luck guys","3255":"Prediction: Tyler Davis has more catches his rookie year than he did in his entire college career!","3256":"Who in the world is Tyler Davis","3257":"Mayonnaise on steak?! What a monster","3258":"God damn it, some one please draft Moss before Pace is back on the clock","3259":"Ayyyyy let's go yellow jacketssss","3260":"GT fan here. This guy is really good, but our OL was so bad last year he basically just acted as an extra blocker the whole time out of necessity. He was a grad transfer from UConn and GT head coach Geoff Collins said he was the best opposing player he faced at his previous stop (Temple). When he transferred to GT I remember reading he was projected to be a 3rd or 4th rounder, so getting him in the 6th is a steal. Amazing guy too, everyone loved him.","3261":"Man the jags haven\u2019t even unlocked him yet","3262":"We didn't even have a TE for over a decade. Now we have one get drafted. Okay.","3263":"Ayyyy I hit 2 homeruns off of him back in little league","3264":"ROLL HIVE","3265":"Boooo. Why not Jacob Breeland, dude was projected to be a first rounder before season ending injury.","3266":"Moss was still on the board and we take some scrub out of Georgia tech. Lol this FO deserves to be shit on. I bet this was a tony Khan pick too","3267":"Not even an action shot of his one TD?","3268":"I was not expecting it tbh. Harvin maybe next year","3269":"Bryant must've literally filmed himself eating another human.","3270":"Bryant honestly translates as more of a big-bodied receiver, Davis and him play the same position but fill different roles.","3271":"There\u2019s a guy in this draft who did kill someone and he still went in the first, so that can\u2019t be it.","3272":"hes too thaddy. don't name your kids thad","3273":"Which is crazy since he didn't drop a single pass last year","3274":"I like Bryant but IMO Davis is a notably better blocker. Bryant is a big-bodied receiver more than he is a TE, and yet he's still no faster than Davis (4.74 40 compared to 4.71 for Davis).\n\nDavis is also an extremely hard worker and very smart, from a coach's perspective I can see why they would love to work with him and mold him.\n\nIf you want a guy who will understand complex NFL schemes on a potentially shortened short offseason, be an effective blocker, and excel in a couple specific subpackages makes a ton of sense.","3275":"He must have failed medicals or hasn't been able to be rechecked since he last failed. He should be a 3rd-5th rounder if healthy.","3276":"Hunter Bryant has injury concerns and is more of a receiver then a TE","3277":"As a UW student, love Bryant. He\u2019s fits the Engram mold","3278":"\u201cPenisi\u201d","3279":"Bryant has injury concerns and is more of a WR then TE","3280":"I do a lot of scouting, but I\u2019m not super familiar with a Davis. What are we getting with him?","3281":"*Doubt*","3282":"He's the\u00a0dude, playin' the dude, disguised as another  dude.","3283":"He transfered to GT and he was with us for a year on a bad offense.","3284":"The ought to go over well in r\/Jaguars. \ud83d\ude02","3285":"You answered your own question.","3286":"It\u2019s round 6 buddy","3287":"As a tech fan shocked he got drafted. We didnt use him at all this year. 17 catches. He was a grad transfer.","3288":"r\/nfl would explode if\/when harvin gets drafted. a punter and he\u2019s thicc, can you imagine a better combo","3289":"Bruh you don\u2019t even know your own draft pick lmao","3290":"Who?","3291":"Who","3292":"Hes a project, and he wont catch more balls next year even with jefferson gone","3293":"Davis was a captain for us as soon as he transfered in, great guy to have in the locker room. Plus he was still our 3rd best reciever and only 4 receptions kess than are leading WR. Ran a 4.65 at his pro-day (although obviously not official)","3294":"That\u2019s Harrison Bryant","3295":"Got Harrison not Hunter.","3296":"That\u2019s Harrison Bryant","3297":"That\u2019s Harrison Bryant out of FAU","3298":"i watched every GT game, and honestly i couldn\u2019t tell you. only played one year for us, transferred in because we ditched the triple option and we had no TEs. never saw him do anything bad enough to stick out in my mind, but also not anything crazy talented (which could be in part because our offense was pretty bad in our first year of the scheme switch, so he didn\u2019t get many opportunities)","3299":"A giant question mark who seems good enough to play in the NFL but isn't spectacular on the field? Which is part of why they like him I think. We just switched to a non-triple option scheme and needed any TE we could get.\n\nHe's an effective blocker, won't light up the receiving game but can catch a few passes, learns quickly, and is smart. He's big and fast enough to play TE (4.7 40 at 6'4\", 240) at the NFL level and he's versatile enough to fill blocking and receiving roles and backup multiple different types of TEs. He's a smart guy and a hard worker which should help him pick up on nuances to translate to the NFL and succeed in a potentially shortened offseason. He didn't have a ton of catches, but TE catches in college are a crapshoot and so scheme and QB dependent. Someone who can reliably hit tighter windows might have better luck there, he was actually pretty good at contested catches and using his size.\n\nI don't see him becoming a Kittle-like diamond in the rough, but he should be worth a roster spot for a while and provide the versatility and great teammate that you want you want in a backup at a complicated position.","3300":"As a tech fan I'm surprised he got drafted because he was very under the radar, but his numbers don't tell the full story. Transferred from UConn ahead of the season, was made a team captain right away, which shows how much of a leader he is. Our offense struggled throwing the ball a lot as the transition from triple option will take a little time, so he didn't get a lot of opportunities to catch the ball. But he's pretty athletic, reliable hands, good blocker, really smart guy, and extremely likable. [This video after his last career game shows how much he loves the game.](https:\/\/twitter.com\/GeorgiaTechFB\/status\/1200939801513463808?s=20)","3301":"The graphic said he had 17 catches in college.  He actually had 64... so it's possible I'm right, but yeah.","3302":"Not really.... other players have gotten drafted after season ending injuries....","3303":"Cool, our starting qb was taken in the sixth. The most successful QB in history was taken in the sixth","3304":"No, he's a unit, hopefully we get to see him play this year","3305":"Similar names lol","3306":"Edwards Helaire.\n\nLSU got PS4s for the playstation bowl the year before. He went to pawn it on craigslist and the guy he met up with pulled a gun on him and his friend to rob them. Clyde had the faster draw.","3307":"Yeah I was thinking I got it wrong lol","3308":"If I remember correctly he didn't get to catch many balls because we needed him as an extra blocker because of our inexperienced and undersized OLine. High character guy though everyone seemed to love him.","3309":"Makes sense. I\u2019ll have to watch a little bit of him, coming from GT, I would think he\u2019s pretty solid in the run game, has pretty solid height\/weight\/speed, so he could be solid depth.","3310":"They probably only pulled his Tech stats. He was at Uconn 3 years but transferred in (and was named captain year one)","3311":"Last person I would\u2019ve expected, to be honest.","3312":"Shit dude, imagine dying over a PS4. The kid who pulled the gun on them probably didn't expect them to be armed too.","3313":"[source](https:\/\/www.theadvocate.com\/baton_rouge\/news\/crime_police\/article_b4d9d01a-0b95-11e9-b0dd-a727144c13bb.html)\n\nTl;dr: he and a teammate were being robbed and one of them shot and killed the robber in self-defense.","3314":"Just updated my comment to include info, it was 100% self defense","3315":"Ah. That makes more sense","3316":"Cool. Cool cool cool.","3317":"Vikings get a safety from michigan and packers get a safety from minnesota","3318":"Fuck yeah Josh!!! \n\n(No clue who he is but I'm happy for him)","3319":"African or European swallow?","3320":"Great tackler in space but sometimes has trouble falling behind against faster recievers","3321":"Finally, we're real thin at S","3322":"What's the actual pick number. I hate having to try and guess. I don't need to know what number it is in the round just the number overall.","3323":"Nice!","3324":"I was actually predicting Moss with this pick but a good selection","3325":"Someone Mettellus Vikings fans how good this guy is.","3326":"Good tackler, but pretty bad in space and slow","3327":"He's solid. Basically was taken initially to get Devin Bush as they were teammates, but turned out to be a really good player","3328":"Uh...\n\nAs a Lions fan, I'm perfectly happy with this pick.\n\nAs a Michigan fan, I don't get it. His junior year he was known as a head hunter who kept making risky\/dumb plays. But at least he was punishing receivers.\n\nThen last year he stopped doing that, and just got burned any time he had to pick up a WR. I'm pretty sure both KJ Hill and Hamler destroyed him from the slot. Quite frankly I'm surprised by his combine 40, because he got burned a lot.\n\nHe definitely worked his ass off from being a 2* recruit. But I'm glad he's not starting for us anymore.","3329":"How many points did Metellus give up to Ohio State the last couple of years?  \n\nAs a Buckeye fan, I\u2019m bummed to see him go.  Watching terry mclaurin, Parris Campbell and Chris Olave run right by him was becoming a fun tradition.","3330":"I don\u2019t want to play you dad abed","3331":"Indeed indeed indeed indeed indeed","3332":"Lions need a safety from wisconsin to complete the circle","3333":"You know the packers are from Wisconsin, not Michigan, right?","3334":"Huh?

The big highlight of the Cal D. \n\nGetting him here could be a windfall.","3485":"Actual football player","3486":"Great pick","3487":"YAY IM SO HAPPY FOR HIM","3488":"Every time an ILB is drafted who isn't Cale Garrett, I cry a little. Dude was so good at Mizzou.","3489":"someone tell me how to feel about this pick","3490":"What","3491":"What","3492":"Yes","3493":"Oh. Run defense wins championships, huh?","3494":"Cardinals just can't quit Scooby Wright","3495":"Ahhhhhhhh dang it why the Cardinals\n\nWeaver's pretty much the first guy I've heard of and watched at Berkeley to get drafted for the NFL, so this is pretty new and exciting for me\n\nEnjoy him Arizona, he's a beast","3496":"His draft profile for Cardinals fans:\n\u201cRambunctious tackle sponge and perennial grudge holder who lives to prove people wrong. Weaver certainly doesn't look the part of All-American inside 'backer in the uniform, but he lives for football and plays every snap with urgency. He can be patient but has the instincts and play-recognition skills to beat blockers to the spot. He is slow-twitch, and there is no question that his athletic limitations will be harder to disguise against NFL competition. A lack of traits could limit his upside, but he has the intangibles and toughness to compete as a backup box banger in a 3-4 alignment.\u201d","3497":"Dude had 334 tackles the last two seasons, including 134 last year. I hope he has a long, successful pro career.","3498":"Reminds me of Scooby Wright","3499":"All American MLB this late. From Hopkins down they are on fire.","3500":"He is! He just doesn't have the athletic build that NFL GMs get excited over.\n\nHonestly he'll probably be a good special teamer, gives it his all on every play","3501":"Bruh he hits like a train. I\u2019m a huge Cal fan and he was a beast last year.","3502":"If garbers doesnt go down Cal likely wins 9-10 games last year. So frustrating","3503":"Eno looks like a career practice squad guy.","3504":"Good news","3505":"All I can see in my head is Eno juking Weaver out of his cleats last year lol","3506":"Greatest player of all time","3507":"Tackling beast\n\nOne of the best players on a pretty good Cal D","3508":"goated at Cal","3509":"He was the heart and soul of the Cal defense, honestly think he\u2019ll be a stud. It seemed like he was making almost every tackle for us. I think some scouts aren\u2019t too sold on his physicality, but he was a consensus All-American and honestly thought he should have gone higher.","3510":"He makes a mean ham sandwich","3511":"He\u2019s a big boy and a pretty good tackler. I though he\u2019d go a bit earlier he was really solid for Cal but isn\u2019t very fast or athletic","3512":"Rich man's Luke Kuechly","3513":"Good run stopper, decent in zone coverage, seemed like he found a way to be involved in every play. Kind of slow.","3514":"Deceptively fast.  Hard hitting tackling machine.  Plays extremely angry, with a bit of a chip on his shoulder.  Heart\/soul of Cal's defense.  Strong leadership profile.  Might actually be [Batman.](https:\/\/a.espncdn.com\/combiner\/i?img=\/i\/headshots\/college-football\/players\/full\/4035875.png&w=350&h=254)","3515":"Flys around, absolute leader and had what seems like a million tackles (181 Total in 2019).","3516":"Really good player with incredible passion, I\u2019m an oregon fan but have a ton of respect for him after watching his press conferences.","3517":"as a cal fan, one of my favorite players. undersized a little, but absolute tackling machine in college. i think at worst he's a career back up and stud special teamer, but i hope he gets some opportunities to make some plays on defense and prove himself","3518":"Best Linebacker in the draft, 100% serious","3519":"Old school linebacker that's great against the run game but will be a liability against the speed of the modern day nfl team if he doesn't work on his athleticism.","3520":"next michael jordan","3521":"Blue collar, lunch pail guy, gritty, first in last out of the weight\/film room.","3522":"Cal fan here\n\nPros : \n\n-Amazing instincts\n\n-Gets to the ball on pretty much every run play\/short passes\n\n\nCons\n\n-Slow\n\n-Often gets beat at the point of attack. Lots of third and short situations that gets converted because Weaver doesn't have the physicality to put the guy on his ass like every nfl LB can easily do","3523":"Annoying to play against, in on every tackle. Probably high football iq, low athletic ceiling if I had to guess? Go ducks.","3524":"Can tackle, not athletic enough to play in the NFL. Think Scooby Wright","3525":"He sucks.","3526":"He had 22 tackles that game lol.\n\nI'm a Cal guy and I have my doubts that he has the speed\/athleticism to really be an impact NFL LB but I hope I'm wrong.\n\nHe's an all timer when it comes to being around the ball.","3527":"Great. Watched him a lot at Cal, kid is a stud","3528":"Slow run defender. Tackle sponge but mehh, I don\u2019t know why they\u2019re emphasizing run defense. How about pass defense\/pass offense?","3529":"I mean look at the running QBs in this division.  I think its more so insurance that they will rely on the passing game (here is where Simmons comes in)","3530":"who was more athletic of the 2: Scooby Wright or Evan Weaver?","3531":"Goddamn","3532":"182 last year. He was in on everything","3533":"Welcome to being a Cal fan!  Sad go bears.","3534":"Was maddening to see the defense hold down games but have the offense do absolutely nothing without Garbers.","3535":"Thankfully we have most of our D coming back plus some good recruits, if there's a normal season and Garbers is healthy we can get closer to a 8-10 win season","3536":"how dare u","3537":"Our run defense was pretty terrible though","3538":"He'll probably play 5-10 snaps a game for you guys on run downs","3539":"Scooby ran a 4.9 and Weaver mid 4.7 I believe?","3540":"And the prior year it was infuriating to see a top 10 defense let down by a bottom 10 offense. Hopefully this year both can be pretty good units","3541":"Im confident in TDR\u2019s and Wilcox\u2019s coaching abilities, but man Weav, JHawk, and Ashtyn are leaving behind some huge holes. Evan Tattersall likely takes Weavs spot next to Deng, but the safeties are big question marks. Keeping Bynum and Hicks was massive, as well as getting Z Johnson and Becquette back for their 6th years","3542":"Yeah, but it\u2019s about prioritizing what matters most. Run defense is low on the list of priorities; being able to pass and being able to stop other teams from passing is the key. I wish they\u2019d overdevelop either of those aspects as a foundation for the team going forwards.","3543":"I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll get a shot on STs too\n\nKeim really likes carrying at least one of these slow ILBs every season for whatever reason, and almost all of them end up regulated to special teams","3544":"So I went to google to compare combine numbers and accidentally searched \"Evan Wright\" lmao","3545":"If I'm up to date with recruiting news, we seem to be doing pretty decently this year? \n\nIt's quite strange not being hugely pessimistic about our football team lol","3546":"We play in a division with two of the most run-heavy teams in the NFL","3547":"Don\u2019t play down to your competition. Passing is the most important part of football. Focus on that.","3548":"It's not \"playing down\" to try to match up against two of the best teams in football who constitute a quarter of our schedule. I understand that football is more about passing now, but I don't like people saying that the running game just doesn't matter. We got killed on the ground last year and it was a significant problem.","3549":"It\u2019s not that the running game doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s that the passing game matters most. The running game is the cherry on top, but it\u2019s not your sundae.\n\nAnd besides, if you want to stop teams from running all over you, then put them in catch-up situations with a strong offense and let the gamescript dictate that they abandon the run, less they stay behind. It\u2019s the Kansas City strategy.. and why passing defense is more important than rushing defense, too. You need to be able to stop them when they *do* try to catch up through the air.","3550":"a guy with thr username jprochey once teabagged me repeatedky in halo 3 shotty snipers. wonder if their related","3551":"I wanted Proche.

He should be a good slot guy and returner.","3580":"Those uniforms looks sick they remind me of the Oiler\u2019s blue tops.","3581":"All of his weaknesses are a knock on his size not his abilities. In the draft summary it says he has small size but huge competitor mentality. Great leader. Passed Emmanuel Sanders in SMU records. Great hands. \u201cDoesn\u2019t lack confidence and it rubs off on teammates\u201d is such a Ravens locker room vibe right now.\n\nHoly shit what have you done, Eric Decosta???? \ud83d\ude0d","3582":"The ravens got their guy","3583":"Shit","3584":"Would be crazy to have a wide out over 6 foot","3585":"Used to hoop with him back in the day, always knew this kid was gonna be somebody because he was THAT GOOD at such a young age, like dunking in the 6th-7th grade, amazing athlete. \n\nRavens got themselves a baller, he is gonna be good.","3586":"Happy we got a second WR but it feels really late to get one even in this draft.","3587":"Lmao","3588":"Never forget","3589":"You guys OBVIOUSLY don't need recievers","3590":"Hodgins and Hill are somehow still on the board so there hope for you yet","3591":"Packers don\u2019t need receivers wtf are you on.

I want lamar Jackson to throw a pick to himself next year","3597":"He\u2019s been in Kipers best remaining players top 5 since the first pick of the fourth round","3598":"SMU grad here. He\u2019s basically Cole Beasley (crafty, good hands, productive) except he had even more responsibility and success than Beasley in college. I really wanted The Eagles to take him but he\u2019s not a burner which is our only concern this year, apparently.","3599":"They're trading in the hopes that Green Bay will finally draft a WR","3600":"Any other teams wanna give the vikes a 5th next year for their next 6th?","3601":"Do you know the compensation we got for the pick?","3602":"Reaching for an average qb in the first round when you had much bigger needs.","3603":"Quarantine?","3604":"Omar Kelly - Dolphins beat writer ADORES him.

Victor doesn't have the production.\n\nLol this is the most vague summary I\u2019ve ever seen. Can you actually back up any of that?","3646":"Lmao i never thought of this but this furthers the sentence i read earlier of \u201cEDC took that Titans loss very personal\u201d. \n\nIt\u2019s not funny but it\u2019s hilarious I\u2019m so excited.","3647":"Receivers who can catch hasn't really been the Ravens thing this past decade.","3648":"It definitely isn't, I'll give you an example of how the Dutch version of Goodell has handled Corona so far. \n\nHe's given absolutely zero clarity until two days ago on the rest of the league year and did so by declaring we're not finishing the season which is supposed to run through to June (which I agree with), he let the teams in the first and second league vote on whether or not there should be promotion and relegation this season based on the average points per game, 16 clubs voted for, 9 against and 9 didn't vote. He then decided that he there wouldn't be promotion and relegation this season despite the vote. There's absolutely no leadership in the Dutch FA (board of the league), same goes for most FA's in soccer, it's all filled up by lightweights who don't know how to make a decision and have no understanding of any situations, it's absolutely terrible. Goodell might make some choices fans don't like but he and the NFL take stances and are clear in their decision-making which is most important, there's none of that in soccer.","3649":"Proche is good","3650":"Mack broke his foot in 2018 and basically \"lost\" a starting job lost some speed and never developed\/got the playing time people expected.  And a hamstring injury in 2019 limited him.  A lot of gametime decisions\n\nHill is 6' 190 with a 4.6 40 32.5 inch vert and a 114 broad jump which are all awful numbers.  Watching him he has zero rac ability due to that as well.\n\nVictors most yardage was 573 yards on 35 catches otherwise he has 21 and 23 catches the previous two years, never started.\n\nI think Victor has the best pro potential (Mack if he didnt suffer injuries maybe).  But it's not surprising to see all of them fall.","3651":"We were right there, in terms of making a run to the SB, and they exposed the holes in our offence and defence in embarrassing fashion. Hope this draft & the other moves we made\/make prevents that from happening again.","3652":"Im excited about the idea we\u2019ll probably be re signing McPhee. Jeff Zrebiec tweeted a while ago and said that he\u2019s surprised the deal hasn\u2019t happened yet but knows there\u2019s mutual interest. \n\nMatthews would be cool to rotate in as well if there will be enough training camp to get him integrated after all this Covid stuff.","3653":"Why does Goodell look and sound like he just finished crying lmao","3654":"The first two comments I've read are like on polar ends on the spectrum from each other. One is calling him a steal the other one is saying he'll never produce at the NFL level","3655":"4.35 40 time","3656":"You cannot ever call our team slow again.","3657":"You bitches want receivers? -Howie","3658":"Goodell talks like he just got done getting yelled at and he\u2019s trying not to cry","3659":"This is exactly what a sixth round pick should be - a physical specimen who needs coaching to produce at the next level.\n\nCan\u2019t teach speed - can teach pretty much anything else.","3660":"Put Eagles and Raiders in Prime Time. 45+ Yard bombs every play, followed up by 100 meter dash","3661":"Eagles acquired am entire  WR Corp in the last 48 hours","3662":"SPEEEEEEEEEED","3663":"This guy is a good football player and receiver,  the steal of the draft","3664":"3rd fastest 40 at the combine.

Big thing is getting the group bolstered with talent so that if we have any injuries we can still field good players.","3745":"Considering our only established WRs are injury prone as hell, and we got very little production from the group as a whole, it makes sense to stack up in the draft.

Also no depth at safety behind JJ and Rapp so lets goooo","3774":"Canton gets their guy","3775":"\\*The next Theo Riddick","3776":"Pick 199.","3777":"Buckeye fan. Longtime starter with us. Good instincts, good tackling. Played single high for us last year. More solid than flashy, but he could be be a decent rotational\/special teamer","3778":"It\u2019s pick 199 he\u2019s gonna wear a gold jacket","3779":"Not the next Tom Brady","3780":"Feel good","3781":"I was hoping the Bills got him late. Lot of upside","3782":"Well we took his brother in the 7th a few years ago and he tore his ACL twice in camp and never played a snap for his so...","3783":"Is he related to the other Fullers?","3784":"!remindme 5 years","3785":"Same \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2642\ufe0f maybe we get stone now or just noone since they want to move that late round CB to safety","3786":"So do I and they won\u2019t change it. Me and my whole family and friends have even signed petitions.. feels bad","3787":"or the best free safety the NFL has seen.","3788":"He is related to Devin Fuller who played for ATL but not Kyle, Kendall, Corey, and Vincent","3789":"He\u2019s also related to sinbad","3790":"!remindme 2 years","3791":"What about Will?","3792":"!remindme 15 years","3793":"nope","3794":"I like it.

I mean great pick","3799":"The second safety named Antoine Jr","3800":"So we like Maryland players now?","3801":"Jesus he looks thicc","3802":"Pittsburgh Terps baby","3803":"Looks like the big safety that\u2019s been the trend lately.","3804":"Penis","3805":"For anyone wondering, this makes 5 Terps on the Steelers roster.","3806":"MINKAH IN SHAMBLES","3807":"Was hoping for Hill or Gordon, but I'll take it","3808":"I want Air Gordon in the 7th, just cuz","3809":"Might be worth noting that Mike Tomlin\u2019s son plays for Maryland... and they\u2019ve drafted two players from there so far.","3810":"steelers colors with that helmet is pretty cool looking","3811":"He\u2019s a big box boi, perfect complement to Minkah. Does Minkah usually play single high?","3812":"Tomlin and the coaching staff has a lot of connection to Maryland through Bradbury & Tomlin's kid...I would imagine in a year where there's not a lot of pre-draft contact, it's nice to have a level of familiarity","3813":"Mike Tomlin\u2019s son plays for Maryland.","3814":"I don't like it.","3815":"Tomlin's son plays for the Terps. So I'm sure he watched a ton of film on these guys","3816":"Mike Tomlin\u2019s son is on the team","3817":"Idk man but despite how bad they are they tend to produce a few next-level talents","3818":"Tomlin's son is a WR there. Canada used to be their OC. Their current OC is a former Steelers WR coach.","3819":"Tomlin's son on the team and I believe our new QB coach was their HC","3820":"quickest ESPN has gone on to the next pick this entire draft. Fuck em.","3821":"Our new QB and possible future OC coached at Maryland a couple years ago. He knows these players.","3822":"Here\u2019s hoping we don\u2019t shut the city down so everyone can watch us play a good team then get shut out 59-0","3823":"We needed a 3rd ILB and a 3rd safety. I think they decided they can just fill 2 spots with 1 player lmao","3824":"which 5?  big red is gone..","3825":"More like Edmunds","3826":"Lol that\u2019s Edmund\u2019s replacement not minds take it how you want","3827":"Yes, but that will change next season. He wants to play high and in the slot.","3828":"Matt Canada too","3829":"I hate it","3830":"Still one more likely getting drafted, but I doubt the Ravens take another RB.","3831":"I do","3832":"That will help lol","3833":"That\u2019s because there are a ton of private schools in the area that produce high level talent and despite the Stay Home movement flopping most of the time, a lot of those high level players end up going to Maryland but not enough to actually make Maryland a good team.","3834":"Ah that makes sense. Hope you guys win the AFCN this year!","3835":"Ugh. That's a shit reason to draft mediocre players from a bottom feeding big ten team.","3836":"Can you not","3837":"Davis, Walker, Edmunds, these 2","3838":"Edmunds is our weakest link","3839":"More like neither of them because we have ZERO safety depth","3840":"No it will not lol Minkah says he wants to but we have two great slot guys already. We need Minkah right where he was.","3841":"I don't. All I can think of is Penn State beating Maryland 59-0 this year and the players we're drafting being a part of that 0.","3842":"That bottom feeding team was a two point conversion away from beating CFP Ohio State when Canada was interim HC.","3843":"At least the Taco Bell Student Section of the Week was at that game","3844":"I didn't know Walker was a terp.  Davis is gone.   So 4 if they make the team (walker and trey are not locks).  Still crazy how much recruiting we do from that college.","3845":"Y'all are great drafters and talent evaluators but that was a head scratcher from Day 1.","3846":"Yeah changing Fitzpatricks position would be hilariously stupid considering how well he did","3847":"Hilton is up for a new deal and Sutton doesn't have either's versatility.\n\nMinkah will roam next year, the Steelers play a pattern\/match based zone defense. If another team is in 11 and they get a seam look, Hilton will rotate to FS and Minkah to man over the TE.","3848":"Almost like 1 or 2 good players can\u2019t make a team good? What kind of rationale is that lmao","3849":"And that same team lost to Temple. So..","3850":"> Y'all are great drafters and talent evaluators\n\nDB is\/has been the blind spot for GMKC and Tomlin.","3851":"He is the weakest link but still a great asset for the team. \n\nHe just needs to eliminate some mistakes in coverage and he should have the position locked down","3852":"Unfortunately teams started staying away from him in the latter stages of the season. That's why he wants to move around more this year.","3853":"> Hilton is up for a new deal and Sutton doesn't have either's versatility.\n\nHilton is still under contract for the upcoming year and Sutton is arguably a better pure cover man than Hilton.","3854":"Almost like if you had a few good players you wouldn't lose by almost 60 at home rotflmaowtfbbq.","3855":"That\u2019s why I was so happy when we traded for Minkah lol","3856":"Steelers prefer versatility. Hence Hilton seeing the field at multiple spots with more playing time (v. Sutton), as well as them not really drafting prototypical single high safeties. \n\nMinkah isn't the 4.3  Earl\/Hooker type, he's a do-it-all guy with the IQ and instincts to fill any role the Steelers see fit. He'll be moving around more next year, he's on record saying so. Like Troy, I can't imagine Pittsburgh really admonishing a young star safety from growth.","3857":"Not really arguable. Sutton is lock down","3858":"UMD was really bad outside of a few guys like McFarland, Brooks and Leake tho. Hopefully things change as Locks gets his guys in.","3859":"I had been saying for years that they should just give up on drafting DBs and start using free agency and trades.    Then they added Haden, Nelson, and Fitzpatrick.    Wish this had come a bit earlier when the offense was so strong.","3860":"McFarland wasn't even good, though. 600 yards on 114 touches, and an 80 yard long one that skews his stats. He averaged 3 yards a carry against HOWARD.","3861":"He fucked my fucking wife","3862":"Best prick of the draft so far","3863":"Bro penis","3864":"This is the one","3865":"Penisin is an ok pick when he is motivated, but mostly criticized for being too soft for a DT","3866":"# P E N I S","3867":"Penis-in-I\n\nHa","3868":"digusting","3869":"WE DRAFTED A MEME!","3870":"Lol Penis in I","3871":"That\u2019s gonna be a tough name to carry in the locker room lmfao","3872":"Willie Gay\u2019s best friend","3873":"I\u2019ve heard of growers and showers, but never innies","3874":"Penetrate that hole, big penis man","3875":"LENGTH\n\nGIRTH\n\nPOWER","3876":"**Looks through comments:**\n\n*There seems to be no signs of maturity anywhere*","3877":"Giggity...","3878":"The most hardened name in the draft","3879":"His name is John AND Penis!","3880":"Bruh Moment #2","3881":"A great penetrating defensive player","3882":"Lol penis","3883":"PENIS || P3N15","3884":"PENIS IN I","3885":"Can be a little \"stiff\", but once he gets going he's \"hard\" to stop.

We have Adams, Funchess, EQS, Lazard, Kumerow.

A WR depends on chemistry with a QB and knowing the system. Why would we draft a rookie to solve that issue lmao. We either need a veteran FA or build on what we have","4167":"If teams are a little worried about the run game, the back of the field opens up, can you imagine Rodgers picking apart run coverage?

Probably gonna unsubscribe until things cool down, maybe around the beginning of whatever semblance of a training camp we get this year.\n\nMy hot take is this draft will be at least as successful as any Packers draft class of the last decade.

Woerner gives us a solid Toilolo replacement as a blocking TE.","4379":"Dude Dwelley is just a guy, he hasn\u2019t done much besides that two touchdown game against the Cards. Not that great of a blocker too.","4380":"We had to cut Kaden unfortunately :\/ to promote Jeff Wilson, but it is what it is. Happy KAden is doing well.","4381":"He's supposedly one of the best blocking TE's in the draft. Every scouting report I can find says he's a \"devastating blocker\" or something of the sort.","4382":"Woerner is definitely a freak athlete. He is also good for putting at least one person on their ass a game. He is a vicious blocker.","4383":"And he was actually pretty damn good, shame we couldnt keep him, we had too many RB injuries and had to cut someone to promote Jeff Wilson.","4384":"He absolutely does have great athletic ability and his blocking was phenomenal.","4385":"Of course, that's why I'm not making the picks and ShanaLynch are","4386":"Starting to think us random redditors wouldn\u2019t be good NFL GM\u2019s, even though everyone here thinks they are the exception","4387":"Well he's also a good player but yeah","4388":"WHO?","4389":"Wait thats what people said about Kittle coming out of Iowa. He might be a good pickup. Moss had that foot injury that scares me.","4390":"I really like Dwelley from what we\u2019ve seen of him so far.

Only reason I wanted Moss. Fuck it, Blankenship too for the name recognition. Better let the pros handle the picks than us sillyasses.","4399":"I'd 100% end up drafting every guy already related to a player. Moss, Diggs, Winfield Jr my first 3 picks","4400":"Of course everyone else thinks they\u2019re the exception, unlike me who is actually the exception obviously","4401":"CB isn't a pressing need like it will be in 2021.","4402":"my two cents: keep your eye on Tim Harris.  He was picked in the 7th round last year, and he has all the athletic tools you want.  He went in round 7 because he was not ready to play CB in the NFL, having switched positions in college.  The niners gave him a red shirt year.","4403":"This will finally be the year Verrett stays healthy, maybe.  Probably not, but maybe","4404":"... What about it?","4405":"Bullshit. Dwelley is a solid player. He never got action in the passing game.  Hes is a clutch piece for is backing up kittle and juice.","4406":"Yes lol. There are so many clips of him lined up as H back, cutting back across the formation and just obliterating the DE\/OLB","4407":"I mean that could work out ok.","4408":"Disagree. It\u2019s a more pressing need than backup TE. Sherman is 32 and Moseley is good but not great. Witherspoon is wildly inconsistent.","4409":"It is. When Ford was injured teams passed on the Niners like it was nothing.","4410":"That\u2019s a much bigger need than backup TE I don\u2019t get the move at all especially considering his production in college with Moss still there","4411":"Maybe, but it's not enough to get mad over picking a depth TE over a depth CB.","4412":"Our corners are fine as long as our pass rush is still elite.","4413":"I think we'll be okay as long as our pass rush remains dominant.  But after this year we absolutely need to address that position.","4414":"There\u2019s not a good chance of getting a solid corner right now, you absolutely can get a good blocking TE","4415":"It was when Sherman and Tartt were injured.","4416":"Witherspoon is a better backup CB than Dwelley as our backup TE. The need for corner was always extremely overrated. Sherman and Moseley tandem is better than what 90% of the league has","4417":"We have Sherman, eman, spoon, kwaun, tarvaris, DJ reed, ward is super flexible if shit gets crazy.  Any 6th round DB is a camp body\/special teams player at best anyway, fighting with Tim Harris.\n\nSo, exactly like a back up TE.  Id say our secondary is actually prolly better equipped to handle an injury or 3 than if, say, juice goes down. Shift dwelley to that role and we are suddenly pretty bereft of backups, unless you are a kaden smith truther.","4418":"blocking te to replace toilolo","4419":"Nobodies mad lol just don\u2019t agree with the pick","4420":"I'd be a terrible mod if I didn't use my powers to point out that he had a 28:3 TD:INT ratio","4421":"They\u2019re drafting mustaches","4422":"6th round and a stache. Uh oh","4423":"Ten picks too early to become the next Tom Brady","4424":"Minshew about to lose out to a 6th round pick and get traded to Chicago","4425":"Expected him to be UDFA.","4426":"The next Minshew.","4427":"I\u2019ll take it! Wish we could have taken Minshew\u2019s teammate, Gordon.","4428":"1. I'm surprised he got picked before his receiver Isaiah Hodgins\n\n2. If it takes you 6 years in college to have a decent year you're probably not that good","4429":"Minshew in shambles. Thought they would take Anthony Gordon, the Washington State QB","4430":"Jacksonville QB room is the PAC 12 North Meme Squad","4431":"Anthony Gordon in shambles","4432":"Jaguars and 6th round mustachioed QBs from the Pacific Northwest name a better duo.","4433":"28-3 TD-INT ratio? This guy's going into the HOF.","4434":"Minshew 2.0","4435":"Lmao. Three years in a row now we take QBs in round 6. \n\nKnow literally nothing about this guy. Anybody else know?","4436":"#LUTONMANIA??","4437":"QB who's first name starts with a J: *exists*\n\nThe entire NFL: Hello there","4438":"Minshew just got Minshew'd","4439":"It's okay for Minshew, it's just a sixth round QB, what are the odds he overtakes you for the job?","4440":"I actually like this one\n\nDoesn't make any boneheaded plays. Really smart, solid decision maker who goes through his reads. Definitely a solid backup option.","4441":"Go Beavs.","4442":"6\u20197!!!\u2019","4443":"Minshew II II","4444":"Ya know a lot of people go to college for ~~7~~ 6 years","4445":"Another qb?? Nahhh no one over throws Minshew mania.","4446":"Well he's no kicker or longsnapper","4447":"Surprised he went before Anthony Gordon.","4448":"Sean Mannion on shambles","4449":"Confirmed. Andy Reid likes Willie Gay.","4450":"Yo this is my guy. He balled at Oregon State. Btw he's a sixth year senior, so he's basically 30.","4451":" This will give the jaguars more comments on their picks","4452":"RIP shirtless man","4453":"Damn he tall","4454":"why tho?","4455":"Actually has the Minshew Stache. Is Khan memeing on us?","4456":"TOM BRADY","4457":"Lot of Jakes.","4458":"Another qb's name starts with J","4459":"Also does anyone think Tom Flacco might get picked since Luton was expected to be a UDFA?","4460":"Bust #BecauseJaguars or not and will be a good back to Minshew...?","4461":"Gordon >","4462":"Slut4Lut","4463":"Surprised he went before Anthony Gordon.","4464":"Wow as a Beavers fan Luton over Hodgins is a crime. Luton is not a good QB. Jags fucked up. He throws way too hard and doesn't make good reads. No turnover issue and great measurables but he just doesn't have it imo.","4465":"The stache in shambles","4466":"Sco Beavs","4467":"Pinned lmao","4468":"Should've been drafted by the pats","4469":"If only he got chosen by the Falcons...","4470":"Haha yes","4471":"Can he pull off a mean Jorts game like Minshew though?","4472":"Khan gets to pick the sixth rounders","4473":"yea what bum","4474":"Please don't. I don't want to have to deal with that glorious stache twice a year.","4475":"I'm actually so down. MINSHEW BABY, THE CHEESE WILL FALL","4476":"Spent 6 years in college to get drafted in the 6th round","4477":"As an Oregon State fan (also a K State fan but that's irrelevant here), he really is a solid player. He could play well if Minshew goes down to injury heaven forbid","4478":"That\u2019s Anthony Gordon","4479":"As a senior at WSU and jags fan - I\u2019m not lol. Gordo had to backup Falk and Gardner throughout  college and I hope he gets to shine with another team","4480":"I'm also shocked he got picked before Hodgins. Like, really really shocked.","4481":"I mean he did have a great juco season then fractured his spine his 4th game at Oregon state. Then got a concussion the second play back from the spine injury","4482":"Isaiah fell hard lol. I feel for the dude. He's a third round talent.","4483":"I mean being on Oregon State doesn't help","4484":"Same","4485":"Why Gordon and Minshew kinda too similar, Luton a project guy with a big arm that Minshew lacks.","4486":"Rip the WSU dream","4487":"Honestly though","4488":"He\u2019s doing fine. Let\u2019s hope for New England for Anthony.","4489":"Only reason why he didn't throw more INTs is cuz he throws so hard that it's either an overthrow or bounces off everyone's hand. Also if Hodgins isn't there his TD numbers go down a lot. He's not great.","4490":"Really solid QB. Worked well with limited talent. Not very mobile. Very smart. Goes through his reads and makes good decisions. Old as fuck though. He's a sixth year senior.","4491":"We are all Lutonites on this blessed day","4492":"helo","4493":"General Kenobi","4494":"Jua Jagovailoa.","4495":"No boneheaded plays? Man let me tell you the story of a game against Wazzu...","4496":"Yeah. Only big problem is he stares down recievers. He has a beautiful deep ball, and starter caliber touch in his passes.","4497":"Yeah, they\u2019re called doctors","4498":"Back up QB is an important position","4499":"He was mocked in the sixth or seventh iirc.","4500":"28:3 TD to INT tho?","4501":"We only have eyes for one moustache","4502":"FUCKING NO, DO NOT TAKE MY LORD AND SAVIOR FROM ME","4503":"For real? He's not even Mormon. Double-redshirt?","4504":"Out of curiosity, how did you end up a bears, K State, and Oregon state fan?","4505":"I really wish the Bears would give Ryan Nall a chance. I think he could be great.","4506":"How has he not been picked yet?! He\u2019s better than fucking Jordan Love lol","4507":"Yeah that's a crime. Whoever gets Hodgins will have a great WR. People are sleeping.","4508":"I had just assumed that Hodgins had already been taken.","4509":"He played one year for them, that was his good year lol","4510":"That would be a really good spot for him. What we all need to make sure doesn\u2019t happen though is Borghi slipping to them next year. That\u2019s too dangerous.","4511":"Not true.","4512":"That is a hundred percent false. In fact, the only reason he didnt have LESS ints is because one of his receivers tipped it to the defense. He has such a low int total because he just never makes a terrible throw. He had a great O Line at OSU and it will be interesting to see how he does when the windows are tighter and the defenders are faster, but he throws hard and throws from the shotgun very well. just a very smart QB overall. Hes not inherently talented. Everything hes gotten hes had to earn.","4513":"As a backup age isn\u2019t really an issue though. \n\nIf anything it\u2019s a plus","4514":"I\u2019m listening","4515":"He got lucky with INTs cuz he often overthrows or throws too hard. But yeah he is turnover averse which is good. He won't lose you games but he won't win any either.","4516":"Broke his neck on a hit against Washington state iirc. Medical redshirt. One of the scariest hits I've seen.","4517":"So I'm from Iowa directly between Chicago and St. Louis so chose the Bears for NFL (die-hard Cardinals fan in baseball). Buddy from growing up played at K State and I went with him on his recruiting visit so that's why I like them. As for Oregon State that one is super random. When I was young I remember watching the Rodgers brothers play there and they were so fun to watch. Oregon State had the same colors as my childhood school too so I just kinda became a fan back then and always root for them and follow them ever since","4518":"Yeah I like Nall a lot. He had some really good runs in preseason I believe his rookie season. I'd love for us to give him a shot as well","4519":"Went to high school with him, he\u2019s a beast","4520":"Mike Leach history","4521":"Because he\u2019s a one read kind of guy\n\nThe moment his first read isn\u2019t there and the check down isn\u2019t there, all bets are off as to what he\u2019s gonna do","4522":"That\u2019s a trash take. Seems like you see people trashing the packers pick, rightfully so. And wanna hop on the bandwagon. But the pick is trashed because they have Rodgers. Not because of love himself. \nBut man your take is so trash it\u2019s laughable","4523":"Doesn't seem like it","4524":"Guess I shoulda put a sarcasm tag. I don't know who the guy is it was meant to be a joke about how bad OSU has been recently.","4525":"Basically last season us and Wazzu were playing our second to last game and both teams knew it as the last chance to get a bowl game because their next games were basically unwinnable. The Beavs had a 99% chance of winning with only a few minutes left, but Luton messed up 2 4th downs in a row which was enough for Washington State to get that one last drive, or at least that\u2019s how I remember it happening. I almost cried that day so I try not to think about it that much.\n\n\nhttps:\/\/www.espn.com\/college-football\/game?gameId=401114206","4526":"thomato fan he is a plenty fine QB. he throws quickly and makes good decisions. He didnt throw many interceptions because there werent that many throws that could be intercepted. He doesnt progress very well but that is not a crime for a rookie.","4527":"Nice! Always good to meet another midwesterner. I\u2019m originally from Kansas, currently living in KC and actually went to KU so I was particularly  intrigued in that K State fandom! Following Oregon State had to be a blast with all of their random stellar NFL talent they get through there. I have a good friend from college that grew up with B Cooks so I\u2019ve spent a fair amount of Saturdays watching their games. \n\nPumped to see what Da Bears can do with BDN this year, take care of him!","4528":"He\u2019s absolutely not a one read guy, but he definitely forces things way too often.","4529":"Picking Love in the first round is just indefensible, especially when you have Rodgers, so yes, that was a terrible pick. I wasn\u2019t really taking that into account though. After Burrow and Tua, this QB class is wide open and I think Gordon has just as much of an argument as any of the other guys taken after that so far. Thanks for your trash take though little guy.","4530":"He\u2019s getting dinged for being an air raid, Mike Leach and WSU QB. It\u2019s like a trifecta of NFL scouts\u2019 least favorite things. I thought Minshew was helping them move past that, but I guess not.","4531":"That game was awesome to watch but man the result was rough...","4532":"Nosebleed of a defense gives up 2 TDs in two minutes: QBs fault.","4533":"Oh nice, Kansas City is a fun city! I hate K-who in basketball naturally but it's all in good fun. Yeah the Beavs have a decent amount of random NFL talent like Cooks and Ochocinco and Jaquizz Rodgers. James Rodgers is still my favorite that I watched there but he didn't make the league. But thank you brotha, good luck to y'all this year! That AFC South could be up for grabs","4534":"I love Gordon but he has flaws. His footwork can be terrible sometimes. And his attitude can be terrible when things don\u2019t go his way.","4535":"Minshew had a few good games. He wasn't spectacular and I don't think the jags know he'll be the guy long term.","4536":"Don\u2019t get me wrong\u2014our defensive line was god awful but Luton messed up too.","4537":"Our defense was awful but he could have easily put that one away for us","4538":"I\u2019d rather have to fix footwork than accuracy though, which is what you have to try to do on a lot of other project QBs. You\u2019re right that he has his flaws, just thought he would be taken by now and before players like Luton.","4539":"this dude is actually a monster","4540":"This guy got any tattoos?","4541":"ANOTHER ONE!!!\nLEGGOOO","4542":"Round 6 Pick 9? Gronk in shambles","4543":"EVERYONE GET BACK IN HERE AGAIN \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8","4544":"Definitely has a higher ceiling than Blankenship, but surprised he was picked after. Good Hauschka replacement, though.","4545":"Free Rodrigo","4546":"KICKER! But is he a three percenter?","4547":"MORE KICKERS MORE LONG SNAPPERS GIVE ME A PUNTER NEXT","4548":"GATA Baby!\n\nShocked that the Pats didn\u2019t take him after letting their last solid GS kicker (Younghoe Koo) slip away.  \n\nBills got a good one.","4549":"Coulda been a first rounder.

Had a lot of clutch FGs","4552":"Best kicker in the draft","4553":"Round 6 Pick 9\n\nNice","4554":"We needed a punter more than a kicker IMO\n\n19\/21 FG and 45\/45 XP though, not bad. Can he kick in the wind?","4555":"STEAL OF THE DRAFT","4556":"*Hauschka in shambles*","4557":"HAIL SOUTHERN!!

Peoples......JONES!","4736":"The one touchdown vs. MSU \ud83d\ude0d","4737":"So true.","4738":"I read every name in Gus\u2019 voice because it sounds awesome.","4739":"Joe Douglas\u2019 black magic had to run out eventually","4740":"Ravens were one pick away from Mims when y'all stole him.","4741":"We still exist here, and the pats just took a farright kicker.","4742":"Reminds me of a YouTube video I watched recently where a guy gave like all the second round picks A\u2019s lmao","4743":"193 to the Colts please","4744":"Tbf, an Andy Reid interview is miles better than music.","4745":"He's a blocking TE, I wouldn't be that surprised.","4746":"Yeah I\u2019m confused by this honestly","4747":"Who are the two other than Hill?","4748":"Weird, Ronnie Bell and Nico Collins had no issues.","4749":"We\u2019ve drafted a bunch of solid WRs in a shitty ____ offense the last few years. Turns out they were part of the problem. I have a feeling DPJ will be no different","4750":"If I had to take a guess it would be that teams were weary because DPJ was not the only WR with an awful QB. But talented WRs can still produce with awful QBs, DPJ never produced (he had no 100 yard games)","4751":"We haven't re-signed Rashard Higgins so we did kinda need a WR3.","4752":"Round 6 is where you draft your biggest needs and not depth\/BPA no doubt.","4753":"I mean, after Juice and OBJ we're paper thin.","4754":"They needed a good third WR in case they want to run one TE sets.","4755":"I think he's primarily a returner in the NFL.","4756":"Good thing he has Landry & OBJ to push him","4757":"We seem to hate speedy WRs, lmao. I think Marvin Hall is pretty much it, and I'd be surprised if he made the team next season.","4758":"How drunk are you?","4759":"It\u2019s so depressing man :(, hoping he at least gets picked at this point","4760":"They are EXHAUSTING","4761":"You should","4762":"I hope you dont, but yes, he would most likely be a great pick for you guys.","4763":"Not anymore","4764":"I once threw 7 touchdown passes in a pick-up game if you guys want to draft an heir apparent for Jordan Love.","4765":"I\u2019ve been wondering about him. How has he slid so far?","4766":"Oof","4767":"Or Isaiah Hodgins","4768":"Unless you grew up in Columbus you wouldn\u2019t understand. Columbus has a huge inferiority complex because it\u2019s never recognized as a large or important city. The Buckeyes are basically the biggest thing there. People bleed scarlet and grey and it absolutely takes precedence over their NFL fandom. Especially when said fandom is the Browns or the Bengals.","4769":"It just sucks because they\u2019re so vocal. I know most of the fans are rational in that regard but the OsU psychos make me so upset.","4770":"Yes, those silly college rivalries.\n\nUnlike the serious professional rivalries. They're so much different.","4771":"hE kIlLeD eVeRyOnE's UnClE","4772":"So fucking annoying","4773":"We've only drafted 6 guys outta Michigan in the last 30 years. Steve Everitt, Derrick Alexander and Peppers were all good picks so it's at least a 50\/50 shot.","4774":"What about Jarvis Landry? \n\nJuicy Licking?","4775":"We've already got BJ in BJ Goodson","4776":"Lockdown been tough","4777":"The People's Beckham Jr","4778":"since when has obj had a hyphen in his name?","4779":"None of his friends went to his birthday party","4780":"The red flags were that he sucked ass in college.","4781":"Injury I heard. Knee doesn't have a long career in it.\n\nEdit - to be clear I'm not saying this is a fact. Just what I heard. That he has cartilage issues so over time he could have problems. With full medicals hard to do I think stuff like that, that normally they would have a good handle on can cause people to drop.\n\nOr maybe he was just OK in his final year on a stacked WR class.","4782":"Probably drafted yesterday","4783":"Cries in jordan kovacs","4784":"Michigan and going down to the wire vs inferior teams.","4785":"When he did the Bunyan pose my heart melted.","4786":"Well I mean the bar for a good person before joining the Pat's was set by Aaron Hernandez so you can not say you are shocked.","4787":"You must have watched a different National Championship.","4788":"Binjimen Victor and Austin Mack","4789":"Probably right","4790":"Reminds me of when we drafted a LS in the 6th in 2018","4791":"We only need one WR because we're two TE two RB","4792":"Looking at how low we've drafted him, I think we'll resign Higgins and he'll be a WR4 because we don't really have a receiver like him with his size, weight and pace so it'll be good to add something different that isn't a TE. But as you said, I think he'll also compete for a spot as returner with JoJo Natson as our returners last year we're terrible","4793":"Shit is contagious brah","4794":"Very","4795":"It's insane, my college team is OSU but our fans make is so much less enjoyable","4796":"I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an inferiority complex, it\u2019s just that Columbus doesn\u2019t have any of the three major sports close by so people latch on to all things OSU. Plus the school itself is such a large part of the community, it helps people feel like they\u2019re \u201cpart of the team\u201d more so than professional teams.","4797":"I have a lot of family down there, but I didn't grow up in the area.\n\nI can understand that, with how ingrained ohio state is in the community, and that honestly it's been the best football team in the state for the past few decades.\n\nThat said, those people are inexcusable with the way they treat some players, notably Jabrill Peppers of recent.","4798":"I\u2019ve really never ever ever heard of anyone in Columbus having an inferiority complex. Weird flex. Some ppl just like college football more. I\u2019d say there\u2019s a huge percentage of Ohioans who prefer the buckeyes over the bengals and browns, including myself. Now I don\u2019t care when the bengals miss out on a buckeye (which is always) but I\u2019d certainly like to see my favorite college players land on the roster. Weird post.","4799":"I mean I'm from Cleveland and Ohio State _absolutely_ takes precedence over being a Browns fan. Why the hell wouldn't it?\n\nI still treat CFB and NFL as essentially seperate sports. Different skillsets are useful in each for the most part in my opinion.","4800":"Implying that Cleveland is an important city","4801":"Can confirm, I'm from Northeast Ohio and always liked OSU. Lived in Columbus for 5 years and the OSU fans made me despise the Buckeyes. I can't imagine worshipping 18 year old kids like they're Gods.","4802":"Yeah I am glad the Bengals don't have it as bad. Seems like there is a more overlap between the Browns and OSU but obviously still some Cinci overlap. There are more UK, UC, and Louisville fans around here. Still plenty of OSU ones though.","4803":"All rivalries are silly.\n\nBut when you start throwing death threats at a player simply because of the school he went to, you're a fucking asshole.","4804":"Yeah they were good picks, you could even say Braylon was good with his monster third year (I think), but it just doesn't feel like they have long careers in Cleveland.","4805":"Peppers was an atrocious pick. One he was a tweener SS. Two that pos has no value even if good. 3 he was picked before two all pros 4 those two all pros were at DE and CB far more valuable spots","4806":"I'll take a Bakers Dozen of those Juicy lickins","4807":"If you have to ask what a JL is, then you can't afford it.","4808":"Comrade Browns!","4809":"O'Dell Beckham-Junior","4810":"Ode-ll Beckham Jr","4811":"I'm a bit tipsy man, cut me some slack haha","4812":"Of course not, his birthday was last week!","4813":"The cake was delicious.","4814":"He was good in college but played mostly out of position (he's a slot) and had awful QB play for most of his career. Also he got hurt a bit","4815":"Not really fair. A trash Jim Harbaugh offense with trash QBs like Shea Patterson is terrible for receivers. I would never go to Michigan under the current regime if I was a receiver, and I'm a Michigan fan.","4816":"He sucked Patterson sucked O'Korn sucked. Oline and Defense willed their way to solid seasons","4817":"Imo michigan qbs suck ass and have sucked ass for a long time","4818":"You got a source for that?","4819":"Ah yes I forgot that one game defines his entire career. He excels at run blocking and I wouldn't be surprised if he played TE\/FB in th NFL.","4820":"Damn I\u2019d think someone would want Mack. He\u2019s made some crucial catches for the Buckeyes.","4821":"Should\u2019ve used your 1st on him tbh","4822":"Only to cut him for a udfa","4823":"L I F T","4824":"Yup, same here","4825":"That seems nitpicky to change \"4 major sports\" to 3 just because Columbus has a hockey team.  No one has ever referred to anything as \"the three major sports\".","4826":"Yep, live in cbus and the Browns fans who want OSU players are just way bigger OSU fans than Browns fans. I don't blame them, but wanting OSU kids for the sake of OSU is dumb. It goes both ways, I grew up in NEO and am definitely a bigger Browns fan than Buckeye. Go Zips","4827":"I mean y\u2019all have the blue jackets but that\u2019s never been worth all that much","4828":"I feel you. There\u2019s no reason to care about where your NFL players went to school in terms of rivalries. We draft Michigan guys, we draft Clemson guys. I hate those schools but they produce good players who I will welcome to the Browns.","4829":"Ughhh I liked peppers","4830":"I\u2019m originally from close to Cincinnati, but I agree.","4831":"Cleveland is ashamed of you.","4832":"Are we implying Cincinnati is?","4833":"Indeed, much better to worship the 18 year olds when they enter the draft and are 21-23 lol. I always say if they ain\u2019t mid 20s to 30s I ain\u2019t buying a jersey!","4834":"Everitt and Alexander didn't really have a choice. They would've stuck around a while. \n\nAlso we're talking about a 6th round pick here. If we weren't so thin at WR he'd be fighting for a roster spot.","4835":"Braylon was legitimately really good","4836":"Jim Harbaugh kills draft stock.","4837":"He still did worse than Nico Collins. It wasn\u2019t all on Patterson.","4838":"No just hearsay on Reddit. Something about cartilage. I'm not saying it's a fact.","4839":"Nah, it doesn't define his whole career, but that game is just an example of his skills. He also never dropped a pass the whole time at LSU.","4840":"Doesn't Mack scream of a Pats UDFA? Shocked he went ubdrafted.","4841":"Also had some problems with dropping IIRC","4842":"Yeah CBJ definitely have their own niche of crazy loyal fans (as do the Columbus Crew), but the volume of people is minuscule compared to OSU fans.","4843":"Lol cause I support my college's football team that has a vastly more competent organization than the professional football team that I share no connection to other than growing up in the same city?\n\nI mean maybe you didn't go to a university with good athletics, but you definitely feel much more of a connection to it than pro teams.","4844":"No, I live in Columbus. None of the three major cities in Ohio is \u201cimportant.\u201d To pretend that Cincinnati and Cleveland are and Columbus isn\u2019t is weird. Those cities are older and have more name recognition but all stats show Columbus is the rising city with a future. Still, it\u2019s not important, and neither are Cleveland or Cincinnati.","4845":"I mean I think they all have their different aspects that make them fairly important. Obviously Columbus is booming compared to the others two but Cleveland still has a huge medical industry and has been revitalized the last few years. I don't know enough about Cincinnati to say but I imagine they have some sort of industry to hang their hats on.","4846":"Aloha to you too buddy","4847":"This isn't a longsnapper","4848":"Reunited with Drue Tranquill. Nice.","4849":"We just love at least one Notre Dame guy a year","4850":"Who cares about this pick?\n\nTHERE WAS A LONG SNAPPER!","4851":"He\u2019s an aggressive, instinctive safety that was super fun to watch in college. Think he\u2019s at the very least a great special teams addition.","4852":"Gilman was an absolute stud for ND after he transferred in from Navy. Heckuva player.","4853":"he once had a speeding ticket so he fell in the draft.....Trey Wingo probably","4854":"Between Tranquil and Gilman, the Chargers are going to have two of the highest effort guys ND has ever produced.","4855":"Aloha and hello","4856":"DPJ must have murdered someone or something","4857":"Wrong ND safety though, Jalen Elliott is better","4858":"Who?","4859":"And Jerry Tillery!","4860":"Both Tranquill and Gilman were captains and team leaders at ND.","4861":"I actually think he\u2019ll be good. Plays hard. [this](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ndfootball\/status\/1041062780772798464?s=21)  is one of my favorite plays from him. He\u2019ll help out in the run game too so I think that helps give him some versatility.","4862":"As an alum I\u2019ll keep my phone on","4863":"100%\n\nHe\u2019s everything you want this late. Great leader too.","4864":"Maybe he\u2019s just kind of not a great fit for the NFL","4865":"Or been  3%er... Wait...","4866":"Jalen Elliott is really really good at positioning but Gilman is a dog and brings a good intensity to any locker room","4867":"Different types of players but I will say purely as college players, they were about equal. Elliott was often underappreciated relative to Gilman by ND fans though.","4868":"Imagine saying this in the 6th round","4869":"Only a team captain on one of the most high profile sports teams in the country at any level.","4870":"You guys have a type.","4871":"What a team effort there. Troy Pride Jr (drafted by the Panthers this year) held him while Gilman ripped the ball out and Julian Love (drafted by the Giants last year) recovered it. ND has been good at developing DBs. Just need to start landing more blue chip guys in the recruiting process.","4872":"DPJ to Pats confirmed","4873":"Can confirm, as a ND alum myself I\u2019ve gotten into plenty of arguments about Elliott\u2019s value. I\u2019d like to see him put on a little weight and become a full blown box safety if he can retain his speed at a higher weight","4874":"Lol got eem","4875":"Isaac Rochelle too.

Everyone keeps saying their OL is terrible or going to hold them back but they\u2019re legitimately a top 10 OL on paper IMO, to go along with the best OL coach in football. They drafted Dalton Risner last year who is a stud. Last off-season they signed JaWaun James who is a good RT, but didn\u2019t really play last year. This year they signed Graham Glasgow, a very good guard, and they just drafted day one starter Lloyd Cushenberry. Their only weakness is Bolles at LT and he\u2019s serviceable when not holding.\n\nIf their offense falters, it won\u2019t be because of the OL or Bolles. It\u2019ll be because Drew Lock didn\u2019t meet expectations.","5530":"I walked out of the room when we made that pick with great CB\u2019s and Ezra still on the board. My zoom chat with fellow Mizzou alumni and Chiefs fans had to talk me down.","5531":"Pure talent alone put him 2and round at worst. But lower body injuries on such a huge frame is a valid concern. If he can stay healthy, hes the best IOL in the draft. Absolute steal.","5532":"Haha what? How do you figure with that much injury risk?","5533":"u\/ear_cheese","5534":"Just a testament to how risky Muti is. He's basically the biggest all or nothing pick in this entire draft. \n\nEither him or maybe Tua.","5535":"Their iOL1.\n\nI really wanted that dude, especially if the new direction of this team is to pound the rock.","5536":"That's crazy. Great pick. Denver really getting an offense for Lock. No excuses.","5537":"Schlereth and Polumbus can stop bitching now.","5538":"So excited to see hamburglar","5539":"Bruh, you have Redskins flair","5540":"Coming from a Redskins fan lol","5541":"Find the posts about our new kicker and go be with your people","5542":"You're right. Fucking impressive regardless.","5543":"Great player but significant injury history. Played like 19 games in 4 years","5544":"He's very boom or bust. He has massive injury concerns.","5545":"Yeah but he's pretty busted up","5546":"That's why he fell to here. Probably a 2-3rd round talent wise.","5547":"But in the 6th you can\u2019t go wrong either way I don\u2019t imagine","5548":"First negative thing I've seen a Packers fan say about their draft! Would be interested to see how these kind of guys, guys pff are high on that go late, work out though","5549":"That made me legit lol","5550":"I\u2019m grabbing my pitchfork and running","5551":"Well that\u2019s not good","5552":"I feel like that\u2019s exactly my point ...","5553":"The problem with him was that he's had his sophomore and junior seasons cut short by first and Achilles tendon rupture, and then a Lisfranc francture. He only played some 300 snaps between those two seasons.\n\nBut in 2017 as a redshirt freshman, the dude was an absolutely dominant run and pass blocker. Even when he went against competition like Alabama's Daron Payne that year, he didn't allow a pressure or a TFL to an eventual 13th overall pick.  \n\nAlso yes my general opinion of this draft class is negative. I don't see the positional or prospectual (is that a word?) value in the 2nd and 3rd round picks, and disagree heavily with the rationale of moving up to draft a QB in the first round, when your HoFer is still under contract for four more seasons, and the team just made the conference championship game.","5554":"It's the type of player you take in the 5th\/6th though, if he was healthy he'd be a day 1\/2 pick for sure. I really wanted him, IMO taking the health risk is less risky than taking a raw guy and trying to teach him technique... which is what most of the other OL in these rounds are. Teaching technique to OL rarely works.","5555":"In fact, I would say that is decidedly VERY not good.","5556":"Yeah and I think this just more gives us a little more freedom surrounding our OLine not hey we need this guy to play starting this year.","5557":"Sometimes rest helps injury prone players too. It wasn't high level football or anything but I know in college I constantly forced myself to come back early from twisted ankles and kept injuring them over and over. My ankle didn't fully recover until I gave took like 6+mo off.","5558":"#WE GOT AN O LINE MAN","5559":"It\u2019d be cool if espn would talk about the picks instead of coronavirus.

One of very few at Kansas","5576":"Yep. Great draft for you","5577":"we either have to hear about this virus, or how this pick had his family murdered and resurrected only to be struck by lightning","5578":"Myron Rolle is such a legend though. Truly amazing what that guy has accomplished in his life","5579":"Jesus Christ, I was just thinking that. We have to hear about this shit constantly, let us enjoy the draft.","5580":"We need to talk about protecting minorities.\n\nThings such as not going to so many parties while this shit is happening.\n\nFor more, we flip it over to role models Dak and Zeke!","5581":"That\u2019s what\u2019s so frustrating to me is I just wanted to escape all this even for a couple days. But 75% of the draft coverage has been about coronavirus.","5582":"I mean you say that but then ESPN will just start talking about the players greatest fears and most embarrassing moments of there lifes","5583":"Injuries","5584":"The OLine isn\u2019t nearly as bad as the national media makes it out to be. It improved a lot by the end of the year and they made it better in free agency.

And that is not hyperbole imo.\n\n\nThe center we selected was a 1st round guy before injury. This Anae is a pure edge rusher. Nolan likes to have a designated pass rusher. And this dude can do it. He has very good hands at the point of attack. Has a non-stop motor.\n\n\nI mean it's truly insane how much value we've gotten with each pick","5676":"CeeDee was the best WR in the draft. Widely expected to go top 10. We got him at 17\n\nDiggs was going to be our pick at 17 if CeeDee wasn\u2019t there.

We got him at 82. \n\nRobinson was a 3rd round grad.  we got him at 123. \n\nBiadasz was a 1st round grade before his injury and is the exact mold of FredBeard in terms of playing an intellect. We got him at 146. \n\nAnae was a low 2nd-mid 3rd round grade. We got him at 179. \n\nThis draft has been amazing for us.

Great value for the spot Dallas got him.","5688":"He\u2019s a technician of a player that works hard but he\u2019s small and not particularly fast, pretty strong for his size but still limited by it. He\u2019ll surprise some good players when they matchup with him but won\u2019t consistently beat the more athletic tackles in the league","5689":"Part of the arrangement was that he would have far greater latitude than Jason Garrett to make personal decisions.","5690":"Garrett had some scouting background, but he and some of our coordinators tended to fall in love with certain guys in the pre-draft interview process and more often than not would put blinders on during the draft and continuously take \"their guy\" instead of considering what players are available. To be fair they could identify some great talent, like the Travis Frederick pick which everyone called a reach, but sometimes they'd leave great players on the board because another guy left a strong impression on them. They preached about BPA but usually it was more like BPA among the small list of players we already narrowed down.","5691":"I mean yeah for sure but if we really wanted him he would have been taken in the 4th","5692":"Well all of the Cowboys picks are but I see what you mean about the rest.","5693":"Huh?","5694":"This dude is fucking good. He was widely considered a low second to a low third grade.","5695":"damn we should have drafted Jalen Hurts","5696":"You said the the same thing for our last pick and got downvoted then as well.","5697":"Are you gonna post this on every pick","5698":"Projecting your feelings onto the Cowboys picks isn\u2019t going to make that hole burned into your heart by Howie Roseman feel any better.","5699":"Ooh...Hurts","5700":"Lol you salty as fuck","5701":"Take a deep breath, count to 10, and reminisce how shitty your 2nd round pick was.","5702":"Someone's cranky, did you have your nap yet?","5703":"You are so mad","5704":"Yes. Give me more of this.","5705":"Please keep going","5706":"Jerry is pimping this draft though","5707":"Yeah, but after the CeeDee pick, everything is filling a big need too. 2x CBs, 2x DLs, and a center.","5708":"Much better than last years","5709":"Jerry definitely calls it a John Hancock","5710":"I honestly wonder what's going on with him for falling this far. He didn't have a great combine but I figure if any year you would rely on game tape it'd be this year. He is a bit of a tweener size wise, which seems to be something NFL teams hate. It still amazes me you can have crazy athletes who are SEC, Big 12 DPOYs in Michael Sam or Jordan Jeffcoat, but they get 7th round UDFA grades because they are somewhere between ideal sizes. I always felt like that was one of those market inefficiencies a guy like Belichick would figure out how to use and just wreck the league with the next \"it\" defense.","5711":"Your punishment is not complete. It must be continued!","5712":"Dude even Diggs was kinda a steal. Some people had him going in the first round","5713":"Same.","5714":"TIL I am Jerry Jones","5715":"Thank you sir. Congrats on having easily the best draft this year","5716":"by double digits and in all cases except 1st round, by a full round","5717":"My bad. I zoned out and didn't realize we had a comp 5th.","5718":"Hurts in the 2nd","5719":"I love how defensive Eagles fans are getting because they know they\u2019re fucking up this draft \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02","5720":"Jalen Hurts in the second round","5721":"Let us get Brandon Mann and oh god","5722":"Is he a guy who can play OLB in a 3-4?","5723":"Yeah, he said literally \u201cI want control, or I\u2019m not coming\u201d","5724":"> Garrett had some scouting background, but he and some of our coordinators tended to fall in love with certain guys in the pre-draft interview process and more often than not would put blinders on during the draft and continuously take \"their guy\" instead of considering what players are available.\n\nyou can mabye say that about Rod for the Taco and Hill picks, but overall, JG was phenomenal in terms of draft and team building. we did not start drafting well until he took over","5725":"based","5726":"I mean he\u2019s a more athletic, more accurate, younger, cheaper, more collegiately successful version of Dak... so, maybe?","5727":"I could take a billion deep breaths and the cowboys would still be shitty.","5728":"It's hilarious to see","5729":"The Cowboys have never won a Super Bowl in my lifetime.","5730":"Pfft... it\u2019s Herbie Hancock!","5731":"\"Daiquiri my boy...\"","5732":"I WISH I WAS NEVER BORN, DAD","5733":"Diggs was definitely a steal. If y'all had gotten him at 17 I wouldn't have batted an eye","5734":"Better tell Howie to get on here.","5735":"Basically were all exactly like Jerry. Just without the billions of dollars.","5736":"It's fine.  Just a great time to use the meme.","5737":"It still Hurts now","5738":"Damn that was a legitimately solid burn, guess Reddit isn't having banter today.","5739":"That's not defensive it's called a good burn.","5740":"It\u2019s just in case Carson gets the rona. Howie playing 5d chess underwater","5741":"He would do well as a rush end, but he doesn\u2019t have the quickest sideline to sideline speed","5742":"I\u2019m hesitant to say yes as his better moves are to the inside shoulder where he can\u2019t held at arms length by bigger tackles and his shorter wingspan is less of a disadvantage, he also doesn\u2019t have the greatest closing speed so it may be difficult to justify moving him further away from the QB. I think if he bulks up to around 265-270 he can make a very productive rotational DE though I can\u2019t say for sure he should be a starter. \n\nFantastic value even still.","5743":"Wouldn't that blend with about the same time McClay took over? All I'm saying is under Garrett\/Rod they would have taken Chaisson over Lamb 9 times out of 10. They always stuck to guys they had on their 30 visits, especially in the first round or two. This draft was a breath of fresh air in terms of going BPA for real.","5744":"maybe he\u2019ll end up starting then","5745":"Sounds like you guys will have quite the QB battle in camp.","5746":">More Athletic\n\nTons of QB's have been more athletic than him \n\n>Cheaper, younger\n\nSure but that means nothing\n\n> more accurate\n\nLmao\n\n>more collegiately successful\n\nYeah so were Tim Tebow, Jameis Winston, Marcus Mariota and AJ McCaron how did they turn out","5747":"Is that why they drafted him? In the hopes he is better than Dak aka an upgrade over Wentz.","5748":"i want to print this comment out and have it framed, god damn","5749":"And your shitty pick is still there.","5750":"I need a little more salt to boil my pasta, got any for me neighbor?","5751":"Took 52 years for your shitty org","5752":"They have won 5 titles in my lifetime, which is really all that matters to me.","5753":"There are reports that we were targeting Diggs at 17 because we put the chances of CeeDee falling at like 1%.","5754":"I think it was just a little...idk the word. We\u2019ve been killing it and y\u2019all not so much so maybe the tides have turned for this weekend. I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be back to shitting on the cowboys by Monday lol","5755":"Lol calling your own comment a good burn","5756":"> Wouldn't that blend with about the same time McClay took over? All I'm saying is under Garrett\/Rod they would have taken Chaisson over Lamb 9 times out of 10.\n\nonly if he was BPA. Garrett often took BPA even if it was unpopular,  fredbeard, and Martin, for example were thought to be reaches. I think when it came to drafting D, he took Rod's advice, considering Rod's level of experience and success ( and we got Dlaw and Randy that way), yea, the taco pick was bad, but don't let recency bias infect your opinion, our entire draft and teambuilding strategy changed dramatically when JG took over","5757":"Would not be surprised to see him start in the playoffs","5758":"I\u2019m fully expecting Carson to die of Coronavirus the day of this year\u2019s Divisional playoff game, so I was pretty understanding of the pick.","5759":"Well there\u2019s obviously some space between the tiers of Wentz and Dak, but yes, presumably the idea is that he\u2019d be better than Dak and comparable with Wentz.","5760":"Which part was wrong?","5761":"Shouldn't have to, usually people react to a good joke accordingly without ironically calling the person defensive.","5762":"Well yeah Wentz will be hurt by then","5763":"You\u2019re using the same rehashed joke that Eagles fans have been using the past 3 days. Quit trying to act like you thought of this yourself lmao, you guys are being defensive as hell because Howie is fucking up your draft. Which is funny because you guys always get mad at us for using the rings argument \ud83e\udd14","5764":"Correct... I don\u2019t think you can simultaneously say the pick is stupid and that you actually believe Carson will finish out the season (he won\u2019t)","5765":"\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02","5766":"Fair enough, at least you admit that Wentz gets injured","5767":"No, but if you think that then extending Wentz was a massive mistake lol","5768":"I can't tell anymore because I'm old, were those emojis a sick burn as well?","5769":"Well yea I have eyes. I can see he keeps getting injured lol.","5770":"Correct","5771":"No the guy I was replying to was using them like a child, he ninja edited it out of the last comment now that I'm looking again.","5772":"Not enough vowels in that last name","5773":"We are just drafting guys with weird names at this point","5774":"Am I watching cnn or the draft? Fuck off espn","5775":"hey I know who that is","5776":"Can I take a vowel?","5777":"That name is Czech AF","5778":"Is he related to Trevor from The Black Dahlia Murder","5779":"GO DEACS","5780":"That's not a name","5781":"There it is, Broncos got their coverage guy.","5782":"The campus legend around him is that he\u2019s never lost in Madden","5783":"His ancestors spelled their surname wrong. Its spelled strand. Strnad is not a word","5784":"I wanted him at 184, good get.\n\n\nOnly problem is I absolutely despise the broncos","5785":"That's a pick","5786":"At the Rice game this year, this guy had a dirty helmet to helmet hit on our QB when he was already being tackled, knocking him out for weeks. Ofc he goes to the broncos","5787":"He should drop the u in his first name to be a bit more symmetrical. Or replace it with a consonant. Jrstin Strnad","5788":"He's the first Strnad-type player.","5789":"Ojemudia, Cushenberry, Agim, Okwuegbunam, Strnad, Muti. Sounds like Harry Potter spells","5790":"What should I know","5791":"Tell me how to feel, please.","5792":"I went to google him after the pick and accidentally typed in Trevor Strnad..","5793":"I'm glad someone else caught that w me haha","5794":"Gorilla suffocate","5795":"\ud83d\ude18","5796":"Lol","5797":"Nobody despises the Broncos. Other than that, you\u2019re right on the money!","5798":"Maybe if your QB was more concerned about playing Super Bowl 50 instead of picking his pre and post game wardrobe out you wouldn\u2019t hate us as much.","5799":"bro your team literally drafted a guy who beat the shit out of his own QB before a bowl game","5800":"Ok Tyreek. Hope your kid's fine.","5801":"Errr mahhh gerrrrdd Jrstin Strnad","5802":"Do not say that 3 times in front of a mirror","5803":"Even Jeudy is pretty weird.","5804":"he's a solid tackler and a very talented coverage LB","5805":"He was really really good and Wake's defense wasn't the same once he got hurt.","5806":"you should feel good, I think he'll contribute a lot","5807":"Good locker room guy good leader, not a huge upside but a really solid LB.","5808":"He's got en excuse","5809":"Raiders, Chiefs, and some salty Panthers fans would disagree.","5810":"#COTCHERY CAUGHT IT\n\nAnd also week 1 2016 didn\u2019t quite endear me to y\u2019all either. Headhunting him all game","5811":"Ah man I'm not saying it like ofc he ended up on the broncos because the broncos have bad people, just meant how ofc the one guy I hate ends up on a rival","5812":"We've got a magnificent run stopper and okay coverage guy, so excited to have a good coverage guy to pair with him.","5813":"Y\u2019all would know a good LB","5814":"But how do you pronounce his name?","5815":"I will take that at this point at LB","5816":"Even if he caught it and you guys score. You only lose by one TD instead of two? Is that what makes you feel better? That does not stop Von from taking that ball out of Cam\u2019s hand like he was a child.","5817":"Well this explanation helps haha unfortunately it sounded like the first one","5818":"Stir-nad","5819":"It definitely is a momentum change, and changes the rest of the game.

Love will be their game manager and you'll see backs like Dillon\/Jamaal\/cheap FA guys get rotated out a lot, with blocking TEs and bigger linemen coming in to replace guys like Bahk who will cost a lot on their next contract (and Green Bay isn't going to be a QB-focused passing team, so why spend so much on someone like him?).\n\nGute and LaFleur want Green Bay to be a run-first\/defensive team, and they're going to finally turn it into the Titans of yesteryear once they can escape Aaron Rodgers. \n\nI hope none of this happens.","5981":"My theory is that they know Rodgers only wants to throw to Adams so why waste a high pick on someone who isn't gonna get the ball anyways","5982":"You can say this on ESPN but if you go against there agenda.. yer done bud","5983":"\u201coff the board\u201d as they show the year she died","5984":"Lmao that was so awkward","5985":"Hey fuck you","5986":"Go suck Kirk's ass lmao","5987":"I thought that was Mike Danna(nanananana)","5988":"We\u2019ve done it!","5989":"The RB pick is a bit annoying since Jones and Williams are a great duo, but Dillion will be an amazing combo with Jones and Williams is probably gone after this year. \n\nSo... i dunno. \n\nJust let us have this one.","5990":"You\u2019ll be laughing when Love is the next Watson in two years.","5991":":D","5992":"I haven't seen this guy rated as a draftable prospect on any single site... so that's debateabale","5993":"As a Gopher I love this.

He's an undersized coverage guy","6014":"The ESPN broadcast listed him at ILB so I think so","6015":"Draft profiles I just read have him as a run stopping ILB, not suited for passing situations. One recommended pairing him with another LB (Kirksey in our case) to maximize his strengths.","6016":"No, he's afraid of domes","6017":"He's great as #3 or #4 receiver.\n\nHe's only OK as a #2 receiver.","6018":"That's also possible. He's a much different\/bigger receiver than Adams, maybe that's all they wanted.","6019":"Jones, Williams and AJ being used like Mostert Brieda and Coleman sounds fucking legit.

Yay Blake Martinez.","6062":"He is insight","6063":"I mean it\u2019s probably roughly equivalent to the difference between a four tech and three tech DT.","6064":"It's not necessarily much, since they're off-ball LBs.

I think the comparison is there though.\n\nDPJ is garbage still coasting on his recruiting ranking.  He has awful hands, is a bad route runner, and stops playing if he isn't getting the ball.

This is a move for Darrell Bevell's offense","6239":"I don't usually hate any late 5th round picks. Most of the time they are special teamers for a few years and that's what this looks like. If they are off the team in a couple years, that's just normal","6240":"Why?","6241":"Yeah this is totally unnecessary","6242":"I don't see him as RB in the league, to me he projects more as a slot receiver.","6243":"I wouldn\u2019t mind more depth tho and anae could have given us more depth there","6244":"He needs some Fight Milk\u00a9","6245":"I wouldn't write him off as a RB. Dude man reminds me a ton of Phillip Lindsay. Fastest and strongest RB at the combine, super elusive, and had the highest adjusted broken tackle rate in the country.","6246":"Sub 4.4 40.","6247":"Hell yeah! Surprised he went this early but happy he did!","6248":"I've heard he will be a slot WR and return guy in the NFL","6249":"Hoping one of them pans out, lol","6250":"He's fast as hell, probably a return man as well.","6251":"No clue but seems strange to draft another runningback","6252":"Read a 4.37 40. If we keep him I imagine he will do some returns","6253":"Dude got injured 2 years in a row and sprinkled throughout college I wouldn\u2019t either","6254":"Easily","6255":"Tyreek hill ran a 4.2 40. How can you compare the two?","6256":"We drafted Swift in the second already and still have Kerryon. Plus Bo Scarborough looked decent at the end of last season","6257":"cuz they took Swift and have Kerryon Im assuming.","6258":"Not the poster but we have Anae, DPJ, and Proche all sitting there still. Grabbing any of those would have been another steal in the 5th round.\n\nPicking a RB is just beyond redundant for us right now.","6259":"Is he Theo Riddick-y","6260":"I'm starting to wonder why Anae has fallen so far. Wasn't he ranked as a 2nd\/3rd rounder?","6261":"Anae can\u2019t do anything in our defense. Too small.","6262":"Fastest running back 40 time","6263":"Correct, one of the fastest running backs and best receivers in college football","6264":"Which is weird since we drafted Ty Johnson last year, and he has a similar skill set.","6265":"I mean 4.3's not bad","6266":"4.3 is right next to 4.2?","6267":"Huntley is a return specialist who can actually play out of the backfield once in a while and line up as a WR. Think of him replacing McKissic and being a better version of Riddick because he is faster and can return kicks and run the ball a bit.","6268":"and have Bo - another WR would have been good, unless they think he is a slot WR","6269":"Seriously how do we not get anae, having depth on the DLine\/front seven is the best place you can have it IMO","6270":"not even close to the same player.  this dude is gonna be a special teamer and isn't going to be competing for the no. 1 job like Kerryon and Swift","6271":"Yes, 100% but overall better since he can return kicks\/punts and also run a bit out of the backfield. So if he lines up as a RB you can't just predict a pass play like we had with Riddick since he is an okay runner. He is like a McKissic\/Riddick type player but all around more solid.","6272":"Well, he is faster, more elusive, slippier and better for redzone than Riddick","6273":"This guy looks to have more wiggle. I like the idea someone floated that we might put him in the slot.","6274":"this guy","6275":"we have a pro bowl returner","6276":"Huntley can line up as slot WR and return kicks\/punts and run a bit out of the backfield. He's basically a jack of all trades master of none gadget player","6277":"IDK. Not going to freak out because our draft has been insane so far and we are talking possibly wasting a 5th rounder but I definitely don't like this pick.","6278":"We already have special teams running backs that make as much as this dude will make, why are we wasting a pick on it?","6279":"Highly doubt he is slippier . We\u2019ll see.","6280":"Yeah, I could see that. A better version of McKissic maybe?","6281":"Who has injury issues.","6282":"Who is unplayable in man to man defense.","6283":"we have a pro bowl returner in Agnew","6284":"It\u2019s special teams depth. Plus he\u2019s a top tier kick\/punt returner and can replace McKissic as the pass catching back that lines up in the slot every once in a while.\n\nAlso, he had the fastest 40 time of all running backs. I would\u2019ve liked to see DLine but honestly, we\u2019re in the 5th round, you go BPA","6285":"Maybe they think he\u2019s better and can actually contribute to the team. We\u2019ve all seen big returns instantly change a game\u2019s outlook. Similarly we\u2019ve all seen random day 3 picks not even make the roster cuz they don\u2019t bring anything to the table (remember Antwione Williams and Jeremiah Ledbetter? Me neither)","6286":"Yes, good comparison","6287":"Plus he cant play his listed role as CB. Huntley can actually play RB and line up as a slot receiver.","6288":"He doesn\u2019t play all of the games though, he\u2019s had quite some injuries for a special team ace, so in the 5th round it\u2019s not bad value to get someone that can cover for him and also take snaps on offense","6289":"Is that not what Ty Johnson was for last year?","6290":"He\u2019s not a return specialist","6291":"Bust. Not every pick hits.

Hurts was a surprise but he still fills a need in the longterm, so it's not the raging trashcan of a pick fans are acting like it was.","6528":"tons of teams are picking WRs that most considered worse than DPJ right now. there has to be some reason for that. i agree it's surprising tho","6529":"Am I drunk or does that sentence make no sense","6530":"\"Pick receivers!\"\n\n\"Howie is trolling us by picking receivers!\"","6531":"What when?","6532":"Aren\u2019t you guys trying to unload Alshon?","6533":"He has a tattoo of himself over his entire body, but taller.","6534":"Pros: He's one of the fastest WRs in this class and is electric with the ball in open space.  He'll break ankles and blow by guys.\n\nCons: Weak frame so he struggles with getting open through and catching in contact.  He really only made impacts with the ball in open space so most of the plays Boise ran to him were either deep or short, little in between.  He also uses his body instead of his hands when catching","6535":"I watched a few games on him. He struggled to get open against NFL corners. Hes not a good route runner and just relies on his speed to get open. Hes tiny and has trouble getting off the LOS against stronger corners. Seems lazy at times, and is a body catcher. That being said hes a good playmaker in open space and has experience as a kick returner. Hes a low risk\/medium reward at this point in the draft.","6536":"Especially not from the bench","6537":"Annoying to have to deal with this but: Reagors issues aren't that he has butterfingers, it's that he had some concentration drops last year. Out of 9 drops, 7 were on screens where he started to move upfield before securing the ball. That's an easily coachable problem and a much bigger difference than say Freddie Mitchell.","6538":"> Unironically does have lots of issues with drops though.\n\nWhat makes you say that? I'm a big BSU fan, I don't remember drops being one of his issues at all.","6539":"And a hard to pronounce last name","6540":"Him not running out of bounds was one of my favorite plays ever","6541":"\u201cLike fuckin agholor\u201d","6542":"4.43 so \u201cfaster\u201d than reagor","6543":"They're both from Maryland but a quick Google search yielded me nothing","6544":"We also addressed Safety.","6545":"Just pretend we used a 3rd round draft pick on Darius Slay","6546":"Yh, a slight reach sure, but if he turns out to be a legit starter that won't matter","6547":"Your draft would have been what many of us had hoped for after our substandard first round pick. Instead we had to make 3 more awful picks before actually putting together a pleasing sixth round","6548":"Probably wanted to say pick snatched I\u2019m guessing\n\nEdit mean to say I\u2019m lol","6549":"I'm still shell shocked by the Hurts pick","6550":"\u201cOh you want me to draft positions of need? How bout I get 7 at one position\u201d","6551":"Not too long ago 6th round swaps and eagles get Goodwin pretty fuckin good honestly","6552":"We swapped 5ths with Miami at 164 for a 6th, then immediately moved the 6th in a swap with the 9ers for Goodwin.","6553":"Unlikely we can with his contract and him coming back from a Lisfranc injury. We have 7 now, we can stash Hightower on the practice squad this year then we can move on from any of Jeffrey\/Jackson\/Goodwin next year with minimal cap loss.","6554":"Yes, please. Between injuries, lack of effort, and shitty attitude, I wouldn't even mind eating the cap hit for just cutting him.","6555":"Lol","6556":"he didnt seem to have  overthrowing problem when he beat the cowboys for the divison ...","6557":"Just because concentration drops are more fixable doesn't make them not an issue. Also, Reagor is a big body catcher which shows he doesn't really trust his hands.","6558":"So yes the patriots fan you\u2019re arguing with is dumb, but he\u2019s right about drops.  It doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s \u201cconcentration drops\u201d a drop is a drop.  If he drops a pass in a game you aren\u2019t going to turn to your buddy and say hey man it\u2019s ok it was just a concentration drop.  So butterfingers is fair game if he\u2019s dropping passes","6559":"And a good one at that!","6560":"Am I drunk or does that sentence make no sense","6561":"Definitely a good deal there. I love Goodwin","6562":"Yeah dude just seems constantly unhappy.","6563":"How'd that work out for him again?","6564":"What? He's in no way a body catcher lol. Has a roughly average catch radius but is very sure handed and body catches are not a common thing with him at all. He excels at jump balls and contested catches, but sure, he \"doesn't trust his hands\".","6565":"I mean, not all drops are created equal. Someone who just can't catch (or can only catch with their chest) is a lot different than someone who has concentration lapses. One of those is easily coachable, the other isn't.","6566":"Probably wanted to say guy before right sentence","6567":"winning the division lol. how has any of your post season games work out for you this past 10 years","6568":"I'm just reading what I have in my notes on this kid from when I scouted him.

Fromm stinks and BB really likes Stidham. Stid\u2019s been in the system for a year, had a great preseason, watched how to be a pro QB from the GOAT, and has much better natural talent, arm strength, football IQ, and mobility than Fromm. Take away his final year at Auburn (bad O-line and offensive personnel, poor coaching that didn\u2019t plan to his strengths, lingering wrist injury) and put him in the 2020 draft, and I think Stid may very well go in the 1st round.

I\u2019m excited for him, that\u2019s all.","7179":"Or his 17 tape. Dude is the best I've seen throwing accurately outside the numbers. And he's thrown some absolute dime deep balls.

UGA is losing a few O-lineman in draft , Swift , and the OC didn't show any improvement in play calling.","7238":"Half my family went to UGA so yeah I watched quite a few games. Sure, he had good games where he could hit mid and long range passes, but I distinctly remember that most of the time he couldn\u2019t do anything but screens and slants.","7239":"Right he did great in 2018.

He played his heart out.","7287":"What no packers dude","7288":"Didn't he lose like his whole offense going into his senior year?","7289":"did he transfer before or after he dipped","7290":"I would have thought losing Swift might help because they had to feed him. But yea the offensive play calling always seemed way too vanilla","7291":"And sometimes he couldn't even do that. The 1st half of this year's GT game he missed multiple of each.","7292":"Sure and I think that\u2019s fair. But the argument being made wasn\u2019t that he regressed (he obviously did) but that he never showed anything(which I disagree with)","7293":"\"Oh no now we have to play our normal defense!\"","7294":"No you don't get it, he'll just lateral before he gets tackled.","7295":"True","7296":"Really?","7297":"Stidham is QB1 you fucking numpty.","7298":"You're rolling with Jarret Stidham as QB1 with no other QB's on the roster basically. We all know Hoyer is dogshit. You're telling me you needed a kicker over a backup\/potential starter? Idk man.","7299":"Gonna really enjoy watching the Pats struggle for the next 10 years","7300":"Call up the Cardinals front office and ask them to take advantage of me.\n\n-BoB, probably","7301":"He did throw for 400+ yards in a single game which was pretty neat","7302":"They have about the same odds as the texans of reaching the superbowl in our lifetime.","7303":"They have better odds of winning a Super Bowl in the next 10 years than you","7304":"You guys just traded the best WR in the game for peanuts","7305":"I never watched the BMS movie, is it any good?","7306":"Theres a place by my house called wing daddys sauce house and it always reminds me of the wing place from that episode.","7307":"can i come over","7308":"He is one of those women.","7309":"it's quite commonly known\n\nin Dennis Rodman's biography he talks about it at length. Basically, in every city NBA teams go to, there are the same group of girls who go after the players; they know which clubs they like after the game, they know where the team hotels are, etc. These girls basically have it down to a science on how to run across NBA players in hopes of seducing them and whatnot. Many of them would go player to player on the same team without giving a shit\n\nI'm sure in the NFL it's the same","7310":"That's some big money shit right there","7311":"What are you having for dinner?","7312":"If you\u2019re from Chicago this is not abnormal","7313":"So has Eason so far","7314":"TWICE in fact","7315":"True - his five star skill players graduated and left behind only five star underclassmen scrubs.","7316":"Yes, but if you cant elevate your offense in college, you're not an NFL talent imo.","7317":"Junior year.  He only played 3 seasons, but yes.","7318":"Yeah replacing those 5 stars with more 5 stars that are way better than most of competition was rough on him","7319":"Myth. Fromm only had 3 more drops than Burrow last season.","7320":"After","7321":"Yeah I\u2019m not sure","7322":"UGA is RBU. Doesn't matter who is next up, they're all incredible, and it's a run first offense.","7323":"Rapoport said that hoyer will probably start.\n\nAlso stidham is dog shit","7324":"Stidham is way better than Fromm dude","7325":"lol, won't be over until BB and McDaniels leave and Kraft sells the team\n\nWant to make a bet about Stidham? That dude is good Im willing to put my money where my mouth is","7326":"Live in the desert and hate it and never win more than 5 games a year and want to come back to Houston.\n\n-Nuk, hopefully :(","7327":"He do be like that","7328":"Put some respect on that name, it's super championship Matt Moore","7329":"It\u2019s eh.","7330":"There\u2019s some decent jokes but you\u2019ll mostly be scratching your head asking \u201cwhy did they bother?\u201d. It\u2019s not even the same Goat House, they brought back Shilo and Radon but they got a combined like 45 seconds of screen time, Sammy drops dong - it\u2019s strange to say the least.","7331":"I'd be worried about what's in Daddy's sauce","7332":"Twist!","7333":"What a career.  I'm hoping the players are taught about how to recognize and avoid these women?","7334":"I mean CeeDee Lambs girl was Trae Young's ex girlfriend so it makes sense.","7335":"Other hot dogs.","7336":"Off the top ropes, here he goes.... RACE CARD!","7337":"Big talk coming from a yinzer... Would you like Allen better if he was a rapist? SMH","7338":"That went 0 to 100 real quick.","7339":"Yes, obviously there is no difference between upperclassmen and freshmen. Good take.","7340":"Josh Allen was able to raise his college team's offense to\n\n*checks notes*\n\n105th in the country.\n\nThis checks out.","7341":"We had a shite system, receiving core went down, and Jake\u2019s mechanics just slowly got worse and worse, I don\u2019t think you can blame him for a lot of the flak he gets.","7342":"Thought so... Fromm at best was the 4th QB this year after a bad year. Why he didn't go back to go for a Natty idk","7343":"ok im not a huge Fromm fan\n\nbut cmon","7344":"Good enough to put the team on his back like Brady has for the last 20 years? Doubt.","7345":"I live in Boise and see so many Kellen Moore jerseys out in public all the time. He's a god here. So many half-cowboys fans since he got OC","7346":"Kellen Moore =\/= Matt Moore","7347":"Thick enough to stop a bullet!","7348":"he said they are. As a rookie you're clueless but he said a lot of the veterans on the team would basically point them out and say 'avoid them'\n\nit's so crazy it's almost hard for me to comprehend","7349":"While he was a pro? Or at Oklahoma? Because that matters a little bit.","7350":"Kings stay kings. I'll probably roll with dogs tonight too","7351":"keep deflecting buddy","7352":"UGA did have 2 linemen and first and a man named swift. It's not like the cupboard was empty. There was certainly a step back though","7353":"Yes, but did he actively hurt his teams offensive output? Because Fromm did. Also, Allen had raw tools that Fromm can't dream of.","7354":"I dont blame him, but imo last year showed his true talent level. He had a weaker recieving core, but he also absolutely could not throw anyone open, which is a must in the NFL.","7355":"The reverse Matt Barkley","7356":"You think Fromm is better than Stidham? Why?","7357":"Brady is the GOAT. No one can ever replace Brady.\n\nGood enough to be a top 16 (half) QB in the league? Yeah I'd bet that. Hes gonna be our QB for a while. BB will win another SB","7358":"I'm an Eagles fan but primarily a Boise fan and god damn it was hard to cheer for the boys to lose but Kellen, LVE, Cedric Wilson, etc to do well","7359":"You mean people can have the same last name?\n\nMy bad I can't read apparently","7360":"Dude, just stop. You look foolish. People can see you.","7361":"Also like always the oline was stacked","7362":"We shall see. Hyped as all hell for the season to start","7363":"All good man, happens. You were blinded by the shine coming off of your Lombardi trophy.","7364":"Me too man. Loving our draft. Super happy we didn't reach for hurts or love. If the kicker works out well be happy for him as well. BB is good at scouting ST so I trust the man","7365":"Ayyye we got a WR","7366":"Okudah said he was the best WR he faced","7367":"Wanted the pack to get him so bad\n\nEdit: don\u2019t tell redditors he liked the last season of game of thrones either","7368":"This kills the packers","7369":"Okudah now gets to practice against the toughest receiver for him to cover, neat","7370":"This guy is really good. Would've gone much higher if Wisconsin actually passed the ball","7371":"Gunna stick around the league for a while. Good route-runner and solid hands. More athletic than combine numbers showed","7372":"What a name","7373":"I love this pick he always went off during B1G games","7374":"Dammit","7375":"You guys got a good one","7376":"If it wasn\u2019t for that rape case this kid would have been a day 1\/2 pick.","7377":"4.73 at the 40...good lord","7378":"FUCK","7379":"I don\u2019t know anything about this guy as a player but he\u2019s got a fun name so that\u2019s something.","7380":"Can we have one Peoples-Jones please?","7381":"Aww man. Best of luck Q","7382":"Hell yes!! So happy with this pick.  Dude is physical and fits the style we are trying to run.  Okudah was quoted saying he was his toughest cover last year.","7383":"Cephus is good","7384":"YEAH BOSS","7385":"well it looks like all the wrs are gonna be gone by the time we pick\n\nGUTE I FUCKING HATE YOU","7386":"Absolute robbery","7387":"Hell yes!!  So happy with this pick","7388":" New favorite name","7389":"Steal. Fuck.","7390":"God fucking damnit","7391":"This dude is going to be so good god damnit","7392":"Fuck. Huge Wisconsin fan. He's gonna be great","7393":"Another good WR. Lions can definitely use him.","7394":"1st-team all-name team","7395":"Why not DPJ?","7396":"WHAT A NAME!!!\nI already love this man","7397":"Nice grab by the Lions it's a shame he fell to the 5th round. I know every pick is a sleeper but Cephus may be the best WR Wisconsin has ever had. He proved himself in a very run heavy offense. He would probably be a nationally recognized star already with gaudy college stats if he was WR1 at a blue blood program.","7398":"He was the only offense the Badgers had in the Rose Bowl. Beast","7399":"Dude is a prototype x reciever, I really like that pick","7400":"Man I wanted Peoples-Jones","7401":"Kinda sounds like an STD.","7402":"Yes, I\u2019m so glad we got him","7403":"Hmm, Cephus with Proche still on the board?","7404":"There is our receiver we needed! Dare we go for another receiver as well?","7405":"Before the Packers too! Lmaoooo","7406":"Loving this Lions draft, I love you guys","7407":"Great name too","7408":"Gotta be a reason they took him!","7409":"As someone who doesn't know much about college football, what were some other receivers he went up against?","7410":"Okudah\u2019s limo driver says he\u2019s the best WR in the class","7411":"As a Lions fan and even bigger (former) Game of Thrones fan, I\u2019m confused on how to feel","7412":"None of the facts on these images are real","7413":"Same","7414":"It's fine. We don't need a good, cool named receiver. Actually, we don't need any receiver for that matter.","7415":"How exactly? Because he played at Madison? No.","7416":"Okudah will practice against Golladay, Jones Jr., Amendola, and the WR who he said was the hardest for him to cover in college.\n\nNeat.","7417":"And if he didn\u2019t get wrongly accused...","7418":"Thank god for that. I\u2019m hyped","7419":"It\u2019s a name out of the Matrix","7420":"That pesky rape case...\n\n\n\nJust kidding. I know it was dropped. Just funny the way you said it.","7421":"I think the 4.73 40 hurt him a bit too. Glad he beat that case though.","7422":"He had much better time at Wisconsin's pro day","7423":"he's quicker in game","7424":"4.54 at pro day, just has really bad 40 form at the combine","7425":"Doesn\u2019t seem that tall either IIRC he\u2019s listed at 6\u20191. Don\u2019t watch much badger games so maybe a pack fan can give us the run down on him.","7426":"He doesn't play like it, but yeah brutal time","7427":"He missed a year of college football for being accused of sexual assault (too drunk to give consent) during a threesome. He was acquitted of all charges before last season. Stepped onto to field with very little practice and didn\u2019t miss a beat. Very strong WR and constantly wins 50\/50s. Great downfield blocker. Tested really slow at combine. I think he\u2019s much faster than tested.","7428":"If we dont get Anae at 172, i hope we get Peoples-Jones at 172","7429":"It\u2019s deep this year, we can wait on one lol.","7430":"If you can\u2019t produce in college what will you do in the NFL","7431":"Cause he isn\u2019t good","7432":"DPJ on paper is a lot better than DPJ on the field","7433":"Because he'll be there after the draft","7434":"DPJ stinks. I would have rather had KJ Hill but I\u2019m ok with Cephus","7435":"Too slow for not being big","7436":"I also love how Okudah said he was the toughest WR he\u2019s faced in college. His combine and the fake rape allegations really hurt his draft stock so I\u2019m excited we get him in the 5th here","7437":"Come on now Wisconsin outplayed Oregon, that was a self inflicted loss. Oregon had like 150yds of offense in that game.","7438":"A Wisconsin WR too lol","7439":"We have Evans and Godwin and took a receiver before them too lol","7440":"Gonna pour myself a nice drink lol","7441":"Love your draft too bby","7442":"Can\u2019t fucking wait to see Lamb on your office.... He was my love going into this draft and I was hoping to god he went to a team with a solid QB\/offense\n\nEdit: offense* lol","7443":"Well he played Tee Higgins\/Justyn Ross in the playoffs","7444":"I imagine he went up against Tee Higgins and DPJ","7445":"Went against all the OSU receivers every practice","7446":"U know what I thought about that after reading a few other ones but was hoping the joke didn\u2019t fly over my head. Turns out it did lol","7447":"Well give you this guy named Geronimo we signed","7448":"Because it\u2019s another WR and to a rival.","7449":"Lol. This right here is just a major salty Marquette boy. Move along.","7450":"I really wish the girls in that case would've been prosecuted for what they did. Straight up faked a story to the police that was completely disproven point by point as soon as the evidence turned up. But by then he was already expelled and his name dragged through the mud. People like them only make it harder for actual victims to come forward.","7451":"he wasn't framed. no crime happened.","7452":"Yeah, that whole ordeal was shitty as hell","7453":"Haha you\u2019re right.","7454":"4.56 at pro day, 4.73 at combine","7455":"4.56, similar to Golladay","7456":"Like teez tabor was?","7457":"Aren't pro days stop watch times? Meaning they're not perfect and usually slightly off.","7458":"He\u2019s not a burner but he\u2019s definitely faster than 4.7, his time was much better at his pro day. His best skill is that if the ball is anywhere near him he\u2019ll be able to pull it in. He\u2019s a decent route runner as well and has a good feel for the game. I think he\u2019ll be a solid #2 or 3 receiver for a long time. \n\nMissed the 2018 season due to a sexual assault allegation but the accuser\u2019s story didn\u2019t match security camera footage and the jury found him not guilty in like 20 minutes. Never met him but I\u2019ve heard he\u2019s a great dude, no character concerns","7459":"Great hands, physcial, good route runner. Average speed and agility is his weakness but he\u2019s faster than his 40time shows","7460":"Really? Why?","7461":"Theres only like 5-maybe 10 guys worth drafting left","7462":"as a michigan fan i can't really hold that against DPJ, our offense should have done a lot more throwing than it actually did","7463":"We would\u2019ve won by 20+ if our offense wasn\u2019t turnover central. \n\nThat game has me convinced Herbert is going to be a bust, dude looked like shit. Leonards blitzes completely befuddled him, and made him look clueless.","7464":"This. Badgers won on every way except turnovers and scoreboard. Turnovers are brutal.","7465":"I think their new GM is a sleeper agent for the Vikings.","7466":"Me fucking too lol, this dream draft is going to make the offseason feel that much longer. So excited lol","7467":"KJ Hamler, Ronnie Bell, Donavan Peoples Jones, Ross, Higgins, probably a few more TCU WR in there as well","7468":"They could have used Okudah as their decider between DPJ and Cephus.","7469":"This is true","7470":"He\u2019s overrated.","7471":"This attitude is part of the problem. The girls should not be prosecuted. There is no reason to believe the girls faked the story. The most likely scenario is that the girls or at least one of the girls were too drunk to give consent. However, there is zero proof that Q knew that they were too drunk. That is why was acquitted of all charges. There was reasonable doubt that he had any reason to think they were too drunk to give consent. The girls had every right to accuse Q because it does appear at least one girl was too drunk that night. The real villain in this story is the prosecutors. I believe it was racially motivated. If this was a case of a white frat boy and 2 girls, it doesn\u2019t go to trial. There was definitely no where near enough evidence to bring this to trial. Don\u2019t blame the victim for feeling victimized. She can be a victim and Q can be innocent. Prosecuting victims means more victims will be scared to come forward and they should come forward.\n\nEdit: I do want to add that based on everything I read (and actual charges) it seems only one of the girls was too drunk. In that case, the victim should have been accusing both Q and the other girl. Q should not have been accused of the 2nd charge as the only evidence for that charge is that he was also being accused of the other charge.","7472":"Yeah you\u2019re right. I\u2019ll change it","7473":"How fast does he run in pads during a game though?","7474":"Ugh don't remind me","7475":"pls no","7476":"No, many have changed to laser timed so that pro days are actually relevant. It was actually a 4.56 but it was a true laser time","7477":"Never believe anything from a pro day","7478":"Yes. It happens quite a bit where the pro day times are somehow .2 seconds faster","7479":"Wisconsin's is laser timed.","7480":"He hit me in the face with a basketball (accidentally) playing pickup, great dude","7481":"Because he\u2019s the terrible","7482":"Sorry I didn\u2019t add the \/s","7483":"He could have played in the air raid juggernaut Wisconsin offense.","7484":"Let us have a thread where we arent reminded of the nightmare","7485":"Jalen Raegor, Bateman and Johnson in 2018 as well","7486":"Okudah wouldn't have covered DPJ, he would have been on Collins as he was the hot hand at the time.","7487":"Idk, I think he made Coan look a lot better than he actually is.","7488":"He's a WR","7489":"Upvote, the people above you are doing huge revisionist history. There was not enough evidence to prove Cephus was guilty\/ to continue trial. Not even close to \u201cshe faked the story.\u201d  It was a shit show and as a Wisconsin alum I feel bad for everyone involved.","7490":"Everything has to be about race, huh?","7491":"Really well, IMO at least.","7492":"The badgers have it posted on their Instagram with a live clock. The 4.56 looks legit and matches up with how he appeared in games. His combine form was just bad.","7493":"This made me chuckle","7494":"Don\u2019t think the gophers played Ohio State the last 3 years. Could be wrong but I think they rotate on next year.    \n\nEdit: I is wrong.","7495":"Yup, had an even bigger sophomore year in 2018 than this last year","7496":"DPJ also was coming off an injury and didn\u2019t play as many snaps as usual if my memory serves me right","7497":"He did, and imagine calling a guy drafted in the 5th round overrated","7498":"There is a difference between lack of evidence and contrary evidence. Security camera footage and text message history empirically disproved their story","7499":"They played 10\/13\/18. Only reason was it was Bowling Green homecoming game and more people were in the bar watching Minnesota osu then BGs game","7500":"They played in 2018","7501":"He had basically fully recovered by the time he played osu. But yeah, the injury affected his rapport with Patterson","7502":"Not true at all. What the evidence showed is that Q had no reason to believe either of the girls were too drunk for consent. Which is the reason he was acquitted. But just because it appeared that they weren\u2019t that drunk based on their actions. It doesn\u2019t mean that were sober enough for consent. It does not discredit the possibility that they felt violated after the fact. This is a no win situation where it\u2019s likely the both sides had truth in it. These girls were not trying to frame Q. There is no money in going after a college football player. Bringing charges forward of sexual assault is a serious manner that is very hard on the victims. However, this case should not have gone to trial and I don\u2019t believe Q had any malicious intent here. Q can be innocent and the girls can feel like victims, both can be true. It\u2019s sucks all around.","7503":"You\u2019re right, I forgot about that game. It was a few weeks before the gophers fired Robb smith and really jumped a tier. I think we play next in 2021, and I think that will be a very evenly matched game, assuming we keep PJ.","7504":"Donovan Peoples-Jones is still there, this is such a solid wr class","7505":"Damn good pick","7506":"Underrated imo, good get","7507":"One of my favorite longhorns. Let's fucking go CJ, I'll be rooting for you\n\nHe is great at the 50\/50 balls","7508":"We're never getting a WR, huh?","7509":"Honestly so far for me this is the steal WR in the draft. As a TCU student I got to watch him a lot and this guy has the size and hands to compete with any WR on the list above him. I personally thought he was a great route runner as well. Great pick","7510":"Excellent value at this point. If not for a fairly disastrous combine he probably goes around the 2nd round. I'd think he will develop into an every down WR but even if they only use him as a huge red zone threat that is still great value at this point","7511":"Minshew getting some targets!","7512":"He was great in college.","7513":"Jeez. Jags got two of my favorite WRs this year. Knock it off.","7514":"Damn 6\u20196\u2019\u2019 he tall","7515":"Couldn\u2019t go one game without hearing him get compared to Megatron.","7516":"Tim Beck had no idea how to use him. Needs to develop as a route runner but has great physical skills.","7517":"This is a super good pick. \n\nFuck I don\u2019t wanna root for the Jags","7518":"If he can stay healthy he should be able to produce and contribute","7519":"Loved watching him at UT.  He made some crazy catches and dominates 50\/50 scenarios.  \n\nHe was a bit disappointing last year coming off a great year before that.  There were a few games where he just didn't make an impact.  If he can improve on getting separation, his upside is huge though.","7520":"What a steal ugh","7521":"Is Duvernay still on the board?","7522":"How do I put -$500.00 in pennies into my bank to remember?","7523":"He doesn't have top end speed or get a lot of separation but he's 6'6\"-6'7\" and should easily win most contested catches.","7524":"Nice. Another guy I had mocked for us. Our receiving group is pretty versatile now.","7525":"Great weapon for Minshew.","7526":"I watched him catch some awful passes last season should be a good WR with Minshew","7527":"I'd rather have juaun Jennings but ok","7528":"Hey look, another one whose dad played in the league....\n\nWe need redistribution of NFL roster spots to non NFL royalty lol","7529":"So is KJ Hill right?  Both are tanks wtf","7530":"I honestly can\u2019t believe DPJ is still available.  I wonder if he interviewed poorly or something","7531":"Jones can't run routes for shit.","7532":"There\u2019s a reason peoples Jones is still there","7533":"And Isaiah Hodgins\n\nI don\u2019t agree with taking a receiver since we\u2019ve already got 5 that are gonna make the roster... but at least take a good one","7534":"He's 6\"6 so I would hope so lol","7535":"You've drafted plenty of offense this draft!","7536":"Your coach\/gm have decided to go the Bears' route and slowly replace every last person in their roster with TEs","7537":"DPJ and KJ Hill still on the board if you love yourself some slot guys","7538":"He was unlucky with hamstring injuries last season and missed half the season. Then had a hip flexor injury and missed the combine. Then COVID-19 hit and Pro Day was cancelled so he couldn't make up for missing the combine.","7539":"Yeah im actually stunned he's still left but to be fair this WR class is LOADED","7540":"This is a dude who had first round talent where if he went anywhere else he would have shown it. (My) Horns have been so damn mediocre for a decade and Sam Ehlinger is not an NFL level QB, if Collin was on a team like Bama or LSU he would have been developed, improved his route running, and been right up there as a late day 1\/early day 2 pick. Him and Duvernay will both be solid long time players in the league, just didn\u2019t have anything to show for it due to Sam and some really terrible offensive play design and play calling.","7541":"I didn\u2019t catch the combine but was he really that bad? But I agree I think he\u2019s a better player than where he was picked but being injured and underutilized his senior year definitely tanked his stock","7542":"Stacking up weapons for Lawrence","7543":"Do you think that's why he got drafted?","7544":"I cant help but root for them with Minshew at the helm.","7545":"he was injured too much to make an impact last year","7546":"Nah last night ravens","7547":"Nah Ravens in the third I believe","7548":"Nah he went to the Ravens in the third","7549":"Ravens took him I think","7550":"Same. He\u2019s flying under the radar for some reason","7551":"Probably has more to do with genetics and a lifetime of dedication to the sport. Also factor in being coached by a former NFL player, and you have, surprise surprise, an NFL draftee out of college.","7552":"There\u2019s like 50 decent WR prospects!","7553":"They still are geez. Multiple other WRs taken since your comment too","7554":"Isaiah Hodgins","7555":"Great highlight tape. If you look solely at that he\u2019s a first or second round prospect. But there\u2019s way too many times he got completely shut down by corners who\u2019re not even NFL level talent. He\u2019s a very poor man\u2019s Hakeem Nicks","7556":"He just isn\u2019t that good.","7557":"Unsubscribe","7558":"Embarrassing comment.","7559":"He was just still recovering from the injuries so he couldn't put on the kind of show I think he needed to. edit: Iirc he only did the bench at the actual combine. Then in work outs he ran a fairly slow 40 at first (like a 4.7) before then running a few ~4.55s which is a lot closer to what most expected and reflective of his actual game speed. \n\nHad some very uncharacteristic drops during drills too despite routinely making circus catches at Texas. Just all round didn't have the best lead in to the draft and it hurt him, but it results in you guys getting a fucking steal so oh well. \n\nI'll be shocked if he doesn't make your team and routinely get playing time even as a rookie.","7560":"I think he was a 2nd day prospect for sure, he was injured last season but his tape from the previous 2 was day 2 material. \n\nHis qbs were not great and the offense he played in wasn't a perfect fit. He had been recruited by the previous coach iirc.\n\nI loved this dude last year and I actually thought he was going to declare. He has a YouTube series detailing his day to day life and it's really cool as well.\n\nHis dad also played in the NFL for 10 years he had good genes (cornerback)\n\nI'll be drafting him in my dynasty league I love Collin.","7561":"That\u2019s what they\u2019re trying to do, but Minshew is going to drag that front office into the playoffs kicking and screaming.","7562":"I mean if Minshew sucks we trade up and get Lawrence. I\u2019m cool with either, although I\u2019d rather Minshew be good.","7563":"Mustache man is kill","7564":"Haha y\u2019all are so mad about the comparisons","7565":"They probably didn't even watch the college tape after seeing what a baller this kid was in his 8th grade game tape","7566":"I don\u2019t know why he was drafted. He won\u2019t be able to get any separation in the nfl. He will be a wasted draft pick imo.","7567":"Dude is not fast but he's a fucking tank with great hands","7568":"I think his biggest mistake was going to Michigan tbh","7569":"I disagree","7570":"Why are you getting downvoted? Sam is not the reason these guys didn't develop more. Yes, Texas had some bad playcalling at times and I'm sure Bama would have developed them more, but this guy shitting on Sam is kind of embarrassing.","7571":"If they trade away every talented player they have on both sides of the ball that would be a tall task","7572":"It\u2019s a joke my guy, relax. Nothing against Minshew but it\u2019s obvious your FO is committed to the tank.","7573":"He\u2019s the Christian Hackenberg of WRs. Big name was a top recruit but just isn\u2019t that good when it comes down to it. Clearly most of the NFL agrees with me over you.","7574":"The NFL disagrees with you disagreeing","7575":"Can\u2019t believe I have to agree with a cowboys fan but yeah, Sam was definitely not our biggest problem by a mile. Definitely not the reason CJ and Duvarney didn\u2019t get the attention they deserve.","7576":"Well if he\u2019s Christian Hackenberg he would\u2019ve been off the board 3 rounds ago","7577":"Orrrrrr maybe he didn\u2019t interview well like I initially stated","7578":"People learn from mistakes","7579":"Orrrrrrr he\u2019s not smart, and not a great route runner. Which makes him a bad wide receiver \n\nIf his only problem was a bad interview he\u2019d get picked by some team that believes they can get his head straight","7580":"Lol I know I\u2019m just poking some fun at the comparison. As a buckeye fan I\u2019m not shocked Hackenberg failed, he never really was any good at PSU outside of a decent freshman year. I am optimistic that DPJ plays at least one snap in the NFL though, something Hack can\u2019t say","7581":"Actual steal. Maybe the most productive pass rusher in college football behind Chase Young.","7582":"I wanted this guy in the third round, so I can legitimately say I think this is a steal.","7583":"Someday Kim Jong Un's son will be drafted and ESPN will say \"His father died from heart failure when he was little\"","7584":"lets fucking go!","7585":"If we are going to commercials at least keep the draft ticker up man!! Shit ESPN","7586":"Miami is knocking this draft out of the park","7587":"I AM SO FUCKING EXCITED.\n\nFUCK YES BOISE.","7588":"Nice pick dolpins","7589":"Every time I look up at the TV, there's another Miami pick","7590":"Commish air hugging is making me hella uncomfortable..","7591":"AMAZING to get him at pick 164. Holy cow we're killing this draft.","7592":"Dolphins are going to be bringing the pain next year after the \"Potential worst of all time\".\n\nWith their QB of the future in the building Brian Flores fingerprints are going to be all over the Miami football club.","7593":"I can't believe he fell this far.","7594":"Miami wins the Draft","7595":"Damn I remember this guy getting mocked at 32 for a while","7596":"sTeAl","7597":"Damn dolphins. Great pick I wanted him 3rd 4th and was really eyeballing him but its just too far. Not sad about the cowboys draft so fsr though. Gg fins.","7598":"Miami has the dolphins, the greatest football team!","7599":"what a pick","7600":"I think Goddell has lost his mind...","7601":"Absolute steal!","7602":"Grandma passed in 2008 and he\u2019s Batman","7603":"Fucking up our perfect draft over here - you do know that Boise State  players are suppose to go exclusively to us, right? How dare you!\n\nSeriously, that's a steal in the 5th.","7604":"The dolphins are winning this draft so far and i'm happy for them and their NY raised Coach","7605":"This is a steal, good get Fins","7606":"I\u2019m really hoping all these picks for the Dolphins turn out well. They\u2019re killing it","7607":"I wanted this guy in the first, second, third, fourth and fifth round.","7608":"How did he last so long","7609":"STEAL","7610":"Nooooooo","7611":"Surprised we didn\u2019t take him at some point. Good pick","7612":"It'll be interesting to see how this guy does. Not long, not explosive, and fat, but he had great production and has great bend.","7613":"noooo, fuck","7614":"Nooooooooooooo","7615":"GREAT pick. Especially at this spot. Curtis Weaver is a monster.","7616":"Why did he drop so far? They think he's too slow or something?","7617":"How did he fall this far? I'd honestly forgotten about him. Fantastic pick.","7618":"Damn I keep saying I\u2019m gonna stop watching after our next pick but it never comes.","7619":"Why is anae still on the board though?","7620":"Her prefers jelly","7621":"This is a great pick up!  He is a beast!!","7622":"Sex.","7623":"This is the guy we should've taken instead of Wunnom.","7624":"And, there it is","7625":"THEY DID IT","7626":"HE LOOKS LIKE A BIG BRUNO MARS","7627":"Okay lions we up let\u2019s get DPJ","7628":"His grandmother died in 2008.","7629":"\"Also off the board, Curtis Weaver's grandmother\" jesus ESPN","7630":"If everyone\u2019s a steal nobody is","7631":"Against dogshit tackles, which, now that I think about it, is also a similarity between him and Young.","7632":"Dolphins are killing this draft","7633":"Can\u2019t believe we didn\u2019t draft him, he\u2019s a Boise State DE","7634":"It is. He was our best defensive player and it wasn't close. Absolute game-wrecker. Ran away with Mountain West Defensive Player of the Year in 2019, all-time Mountain West Career sack record (in just 3 seasons).\n\nHe needs polish, no doubt, but he's got the production to make this a low-risk, high-reward pick.","7635":"You guys are loading up. Ugh. I hope Tua balls out except when he\u2019s playing us","7636":"I think we\u2019re completely missing picks","7637":"ESPN has it on their online draftcast","7638":"I'm ecstatic. This has been a fantastic draft.","7639":"STAAAATE","7640":"FUUUCKAAA YOUUUU, DORRRPHINNNN","7641":"We take the ball","7642":"Thats what she said.","7643":"Athletic profile leaves a lot to be desired for sure","7644":"Oh there's been some awful reaches","7645":"He had a first round grade from a few mock drafts this year","7646":"He actually is a steal. Exceptionally productive DE","7647":"The big 10 has great tackles","7648":"Right? Would have been wild to have him DLaw and Crawford all on the roster together. Not to mention LVE and Cedrick Wilson","7649":"From goal to goal","7650":"It's hurts my brain trying to think of any reaches","7651":"At least 50 guys did","7652":"Great in the big 10 is like Miami level in NFL.","7653":"\ud83e\udd25 \ud83e\udd25 \ud83e\udd25","7654":"And Kellen Moore, wait...","7655":"Like no one's ever seen!","7656":"Jalen Hurts?","7657":"I mean, that means he's probably at least a top 50-100 player and they got him at two rounds past the absolute bottom of that projection at 160 something. That's the definition of a steal.","7658":"Yeah imagine having to go against Iowa and Wisconsin tackles, they all suck.","7659":"We're in the air","7660":"It was a play on words buddy.","7661":"Young didn't play against Iowa, and name which tackle at Wisconsin is supposed to be good.","7662":"We're on the ground","7663":"So was mine, pal.","7664":"Van Lanen was PFF highest rated tackle in 2018. 4 star recruit, 2nd team all big 10 and will be a early-mid round tackle prospect next year with LT1 potential.  Young absolutely destroyed him.\n\nMichigan had a great offensive line with 2 early draft picks and needed to double and triple team him constantly.  If you didn't watch the game you don't understand the impact he had without getting any sacks.\n\nDo you only the SEC can out out good lineman?","7665":"We're always in control","7666":"Van Lanen looked slow as shit when I saw him, but maybe he doesn't suck as much as I though.","7667":"And when you say Miami","7668":"You're talking Super Bowl!","7669":"This motherfucker hates drafting OL","7670":"ESPN: \"It hasn't been easy for Vildor. He was drafted moments after losing North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un\"","7671":"Amazon has found their newest spokesman","7672":"i never heard of him but that's a first round name","7673":"That's a Pace pick","7674":"HAIL SOUTHERN!!!","7675":"10\/10 name","7676":"HAIL SOUTHERN!","7677":"Who needs an offense?","7678":"GATA","7679":"I guess fuck our oline next season.","7680":"Another CB? Sure why not","7681":"He's gonna do a great job reading the receiver","7682":"Switch to safety?","7683":"Amazon would love if this dude gets gud","7684":"Whoever comes up with all of these true facts is the real MVP.","7685":"Lets goooo. I go to Southern and I\u2019m so excited to see Vildor get a shot in the NFL. He\u2019s a great player, wish the Falcons were able to draft him","7686":"CB is a weird way to spell OL","7687":"Bro, someone tell this fool that lava lamps ain't made from real lava","7688":"Well, I guess I can't bitch about another corner.\n\nIs Deon Bush really gonna start opposite Eddie Jackson? Really?\n\nAnd Ifedi at guard is a thing, fuck","7689":"I know nothing about him other than his name sounds like a Mission Impossible villain","7690":"Awesome name\n\nWith the last name I wish he went to the Vikings","7691":"That\u2019s a great last name","7692":"Steal","7693":"Dude's got a name like the antagonist in a shitty teen fantasy novel","7694":"Amazon contract when","7695":"He was created in a secret by Jeff Bezos","7696":"Sounds like a Harry Potter villain","7697":"What a name.","7698":"CB\/ST depth. not bad. Not great.","7699":"I see we\u2019re going the \u2018beat people until submission\u2019 approach this year. Hopefully it pans out","7700":"We need an O-line not another DB","7701":"Can he play tight end?","7702":"I guess the team thinks OL and S isn't an issue?","7703":"\"We got ten tight ends, fuck the o-line\" - Ryan Pace","7704":"They really believe in Castillo and think Ifedi will be fine","7705":"really? cause he drafted at least one olineman from 2015-18","7706":"\"That's why, whenever I get a pick, I point up to the sky, in honor of Our Glorious Leader.\"","7707":"\"Who was killed by Jake Fromm State Farm which is why Fromm State Farm has yet to be drafted\"","7708":"Amazon PR peeps are already rushing to Kindle a sponsorship deal","7709":"\"Pace pick\" on day 3 defense = peepee hard","7710":"HAIL SOUTHERN!!","7711":"Because his name is Kindle. Lol. I sure did enjoy watching him at Paulson.","7712":"I\u2019m a dummy, it wasn\u2019t clicking. Lol I thought it was something to do with tv coverage.","7713":"His first name is Kindle.","7714":"RIP Foles and Biscuit","7715":"Saints can trade you Larry Warford for a 3rd","7716":"We have alex bars too. Ifedi isn\u2019t just going to be handed the starting job","7717":"There's always the second wave of FA after the post draft cuts.  It *shouldnt* be hard to find a decent run stopping safety.  Those seem more numerous than decent coverage ones.","7718":"We could use a center more then a guard. When daniels moved to guard from center last year he was ranked #5 overall during his time there. He was 22\/39 at center. I'd like to see him stay at guard.

Very nice guy who is absolutely yoked","7728":"Great pick, super versatile and just all around tremendous player, really jealous, could've been a great Pat Chung replacement","7729":"So we're just going to completely ignore the secondary this draft?","7730":"If nothing else, he will be a stud when they play Minnesota.","7731":"Pick speed is legit. Let's do the draft virtual every year.","7732":"What the hell is this fact hahaha","7733":"Kala Khaleke Maka","7734":"Played the viper position at Michigan. He was consistently involved in plans. Loved him. \n\nHe led Michigan with 102 tackles (3.5 for loss, two sacks along with three pass breakups and a blocked kick) in 2019. \n\nStruggles in man coverage. Is quick as hell, but small. Dude is full of grit, think he'll be solid as a plug in play, but am probably a bit bias as a Michigan fan.","7735":"He could be a stud for you guys","7736":"Viper!","7737":"Man this guy\u2019s left arm blended in with the person behind him and I thought a legit 1 armed person got drafted before Fromm","7738":"Awesome name","7739":"VIPER!!!!","7740":"Kala kala kala kala kala Khaleke.\n\nRed gold and mean. \n\nRed gold and mean.","7741":"Not sure if he'll ever be a starter but he will make big plays on special teams for sure. He was really good blocking punts and laying the truck stick","7742":"If he makes something of himself sadly all I'll ever remember is that every 3rd day he has to put his shoes on wrong...","7743":"Hudson is kinda boring, C- name. Khaleke? Great, fun to say, whole package. A","7744":"That\u2019s why we got him. We didn\u2019t even know what position he played.","7745":"kha-lake-ay? kha-leak-y?","7746":"Lavert Hill is going to make some team very happy.","7747":"DPJ got absolutely wasted at Michigan and I say that as a Wolverines fan","7748":"Oh man I completely forgot DPJ hadn't been picked yet. Wow.","7749":"Best biceps in the draft.","7750":"Will trade for Asiasi","7751":"He\u2019s a hybrid LB\/S, I think","7752":"Ron has said he wants to see the younger cbs on the roster play, Danny Johnson, Moreau, Moreland, Stroman(Who I like) I dont think a 5th or 6th rounder really changes that room a lot, though im sure we will pick up a S or CB with one of our 7ths","7753":"We generally do","7754":"I mean he\u2019s Landon Collins backup probably or could replace him if you decide to move on.","7755":"We added some good players to the secondary in FA. Can't fill all the needs in a single draft.","7756":">Hudson is kinda boring\n\nYou take that back. Hudson is the kinda name a God is born with.","7757":"kha-leke","7758":"Kha-leak","7759":"Kha - leek","7760":"He still should have came back for another year. The Gattis offense would have been better for him in year 2","7761":"He couldn\u2019t create separation or catch the ball as well as bell or Collins. As great as he is athletically he\u2019s just pretty average in terms of actual receiver skills needed.","7762":"Imagine if UM had a QB","7763":"Yeah his stock got absolutely fucked by having no QBs and playing in schemes that completely ignore WRs. He\u2019s probably better than what his draft placement will show, but it\u2019s hard to tell because he didn\u2019t get a chance to put up a very impressive highlight reel.","7764":"facts!","7765":"He didn\u2019t really help his case this past year. His Sophmore year was solid, but Nico and Bell both outplayed him last year.","7766":"Shame, I like Asiasi, want the VT guy instead?","7767":"Yeah, played Viper at Mich. Could go either way, but probably an in the box safety.","7768":"He played the same spot as Peppers at Michigan but is far more the LB than S he is. He's not great in coverage.","7769":"That\u2019s fine but we should bring some guys in to compete","7770":"That\u2019s doesn\u2019t really explain much.\n\nIs it Kha-Leek or Kha-Lee-kee?","7771":"This is wrong","7772":"Let\u2019s hope Dylan or Milton are better","7773":"I actually like Gattis\u2019s scheme a lot now but yea the old scheme wasn\u2019t the best \n\nDpj would have been best served coming back. I think he could have been a guy taken in the first 3 rounds next year","7774":"Kha-Leek","7775":"The latter I think.","7776":"I love Milton\u2019s game. Just hope he\u2019s accurate.","7777":"I think he probably saw the QB uncertainty again next year and was worried he\u2019d already done enough damage to his stock and was worried another bad offense might sink him.","7778":"Yea I really like Milton too but think both of them will be better than Shea.","7779":"I think our offense will honestly be better next year. And it was a top 30 offense by s&p last year","7780":"I sure fucking hope so.","7781":"The Tampa Bay Gophers","7782":"#BUCS, WHAT'S YOUR FUCKING PROBLEM?","7783":"Our sub wont take this well lmao","7784":"Dear Buccaneers, \n\nWhy do you feel like hurting me?","7785":"Outstanding pick.

I loved him on the Gophers and wanted him on the Vikes but he's a little too slow to be much beyond that in the NFL IMO.","7891":"We actually didn't have much depth after Evans and Godwin","7892":"As a Gopher fan 1st they just became my 2nd team with him adn Winfield","7893":"I like them now.    Got some Minnesota flavor.","7894":"2..one for Canada and one for here.","7895":"It actually feels good.  We haven't been this hated in forever.","7896":"Aye.","7897":"Brady might really be the GM.","7898":"The Golden Patriots!","7899":"I mean, TyJo already plays for the Lightning, so...","7900":"I was pissed he didn't get fired with Dirk Koetter but I am eating crow now. I'm glad we kept him.","7901":"He was fantastic for the Gophers. Made a ton of big plays this past season. Hes a steal IMO","7902":"He'll catch anything close to him, he can reach over other corners and jump high","7903":"This past year he was amazing with a good quarterback, but the previous 2 years he was our only offense. He's the most exciting player I've ever seen wear maroon and gold. I wanted him to be a Viking so bad","7904":"Tall, great hands, good technique.   A bit slow though.","7905":"Love it lmao GO HEAT","7906":"Yeah I had to double take this, even though I know who he (both) are. Thats kinda crazy","7907":"As a Miami Heat fan and a Rangers fan, I can accept this","7908":"Does the pope shit in the woods?","7909":"He was a 3rd rounder","7910":"I personally think so after watching the gophers all year. I hoped the Vikings would grab him. I was extremely was Impressed by him. I think he\u2019s a perfect fit with Brady.","7911":"Wouldn't be a fun fact then.","7912":"A huge reason gopher football went 11-2 with 2 top 10 wins last year. A bit undersized and slow but amazing at everything else","7913":"Go watch his tape vs Auburn in their bowl game this year. He was unstoppable.","7914":"Produced very well in college. Has concerns over his athleticism or lack thereof. But good route runner, good contested catch skills, really good separator due to the savvy routes.\n\nPFF *loved* him, has him as their highest graded WR over the last 2 years.","7915":"Tompa Bay Golden Gronkaneers*","7916":"LMAO","7917":"You can call yourselves the Minnesota Vikings","7918":"Shush \ud83d\ude02","7919":"Pirates plundering Vikings lol","7920":"And gets to play with the GOAT. Gopher fans should be extremely happy for them.","7921":"You\u2019ll get Bateman next year","7922":"He\u2019s also pretty good tho","7923":"We\u2019re new to this lol it\u2019ll happen with Bateman next year too","7924":"How is it cringy to cheer for your favorite team to draft your favorite players?","7925":"Its like Packers fans and Badgers players","7926":"Come to the bucs sub, if we had our way the team would be 40 percent gators, 40 percent Seminoles and the rest sprinkled with miami and UCF players.","7927":"lmao you should see the saints sub going crazy that we passed on lsu players(mainly queen and moss)","7928":"Winfield I understand, another slot receiver I did not.","7929":"yes it\u2019s so annoying","7930":"How does that combo happen my man?","7931":"I'm going to withhold judgement for now... Pat\/Gophers fan? Explain yourself!","7932":">pats\/gophers fan\n\nWhat is this?","7933":"Stupid sexy Alstott.","7934":"Hey now, I\u2019m still a Vikings fan and I think we had a great weekend, but they\u2019ll be a team I watch closely.","7935":"Against ranked squads\n\n12 Auburn: 12 \/ 204 \/ 2tds\n\n4 Penn St:   7 \/ 104 \/ 1td\n\n12 Wisconsin: 8 \/ 89 \/ 1td\n\n20 Iowa: 9 \/ 170 \/ 1td","7936":"I got to watch that live and storm the field.   Good times.","7937":"Are you just upset you haven\u2019t taken any WRs?","7938":"All from RAC","7939":"But how many passing yards will he have?","7940":"Minnesota Wild","7941":"Twice! Thanks, Minnesota! We\u2019ll pay you back with a SB for your boys","7942":"I'd take him vs. A 2021 4th :(","7943":"Hey at least look at the bright side","7944":"You need another punter\n\nWR and TE you're set","7945":"Watch them turn him into a TE","7946":"Miller was pretty solid, yeah?","7947":"I'm vikes over gophs but happy for them to do well","7948":"Nothing wrong with that, my second favorite team throughout the season is always the team with impact former South Carolina players. Looks like I'm gonna be following the 49ers closely this year with Deebo and now Javon Kinlaw","7949":"@beingrelevant","7950":"Yeah it\u2019s better than folks feeling sorry for you.","7951":"I\u2019m pretty sure my brain and fingers just had a divorce","7952":"He\u2019s not fast, but he is an excellent route runner.","7953":"Lol I mean you probably know more about him considering your flair but the Cons on all the draft profiles on him are:\n\n* Drops catchable balls from lack of focus\n\n* Speed is a full notch below much of the rest of this deep WR class\n\nI'm excited for the pick because people seem to hype him up quite a bit for his excellent route running, he owns like all the Minnesota receiving records, and we need a WR3, but his scouting report essentially is the exact opposite of what you just said.","7954":"Just watched [his Outback Bowl MVP game!](https:\/\/youtu.be\/50w15Az09ps) Welcome to Tampa!","7955":"Yah, as far as NFC teams go, I'm ok with them both ending up in Tampa.  I hope they both have nice NFL careers.","7956":"I am, we did not need him or have much use for him. Playing with Arians on an offense w\/ 2 god-teir WRs drawing attention, if he can make a name for himself on the depth chart he has an incredible opportunity.","7957":"Nut","7958":"If we draft Bateman I will eat a tub of mayo with a spoon","7959":"yeah he\u2019s good but he plays in the slot we never needed him","7960":"But that gets said about literally every Gopher who's projected to get drafted every year.  If he was as talented\/as much of a steal as our sub was making him out to be, a team would have taken him earlier.  As it stands he has no better chance of turning out to be good than any other day 3 pick.","7961":"But Bateman is like *really* good","7962":"Except we're new to this.  It makes a lot of sense though.  Minnesota fans have more admiration for Theilen cause he's local than if he were just an undrafted D2 guy.  Also, the fan base is familiar with the players and a large portion have already been supporting these guys for 3-4 years.  NO fans are naturally the same with LSU players.   Plenty weren't thrilled about Jefferson getting drafted by MN.","7963":"That said I wouldn't hate cephus lol","7964":"Would you have rather had AJ\"Toby gerheart\"Dillion instead of Zach Baun?","7965":"Every sub is like this.  It makes perfect sense.  Although I'm not willing to trade Dalvin Cook for AWJ and TJ.  Good luck with the Gophers.","7966":"I was a Michigan\/Pats fan 6 years before Brady even got there. Weird shit happens, kids make irrational choices for their favorite teams.","7967":"I'm also a gopher\/pats fan. The Tuck game was the first game I ever remember watching so I immediately became a fan. I loved Laurence Maroney when the pats drafted him so I played as the Gophers on NCAA football just so I could use him, been a gopher fan since.","7968":"Laurence Maroney","7969":"Can't stop the A-Train!","7970":"Yeah we had an excellent draft so far, and the Vikings are still my #1, but TB definitely my #2 team now","7971":"That fucking game against Auburn had me hard for days.","7972":"Yup but glad Johnson wasn\u2019t one.","7973":"It's... plausible, but unlikely. He's short for a TE and would have to bulk up a ton.","7974":"Uhm?  What.  He's 6'1 206.\n\nEven if he bulked up he's not coming close to TE size.\n\nHe's gonna be a good slot WR","7975":"True, but that was about it for decent WRs","7976":"We like him, but he's pretty much a pure burner and had some injury issues. Johnson is a proper slot guy.","7977":"truth","7978":"Lol didn\u2019t even realize. Was just making a dumb joke","7979":"Well he's no tyreek hill, not even close but his excellent route running burns the corners which makes him look fast when they can't catch up","7980":"Yeah haha I read that I know how it looks, but he came up big for Minnesota a lot, very productive, I didn't watch every game but every game I watched he was making plays, and yeah he is slower than these other WRs but he can still burn a corner","7981":"Man I forgot just how much fun that game was.","7982":"He's going to a team stacked with recvrs so its not like we needed him either.","7983":"You\u2019re gonna do that anyway","7984":"Remind me! Never!","7985":"RemindMe! 1 year","7986":"No, in that regard we were homers. But it\u2019s still a great value pick.","7987":"His athleticism or lack thereof, and an extraordinary WR class sent him down. But he was a much better player than the majority of Gophers this happens with. He was exceptional by a ton of advanced metrics and also against top competition. It is a good value pick, I knew he\u2019d be in day 3 but it\u2019s still an excellent later choice.","7988":"Everybody should want their team to take Bateman","7989":"he and chase next year man wew","7990":"Oh me neither, don't get me wrong I love when we draft Badgers and I was very much talking shit about myself lol","7991":"I get it. I was born in the twin cities and grew up near them and chose the Bucs because I liked pirates when I was 3.","7992":"Lol aight I got ya. Who would hate them luscious [locks](https:\/\/m.riverfronttimes.com\/newsblog\/2011\/01\/18\/update-laurence-maroney-reportedly-arrrested-on-weapons-drug-suspicion)   \n\nMore seriously him and the Barbarian were a sight to behold.","7993":"So you\u2019d rather have none? Lol","7994":"Like 40 lbs minimum lol","7995":"And we have 3 good TEs plus a depth guy in Tanner Hudson","7996":"You think he still makes the roster after this pick?","7997":"My brain said Hockey and football but my fingers went nah","7998":"Sure, but lack of speed is why he was available in R5.","7999":"I'll take you word for it, I'm pumped for both Gophers we took!","8000":"Fucking Minnesotans.","8001":"Easier prediction than calling Paul George to the Clippers was.","8002":"I have lived in the twin cities my whole life and cheered for the vikes. But back when I was a kid and the bucs were in our division they were so damn cool to me. Pirate ship and all!","8003":"Going down with the ship! \n\nJohnson\u2019s fine. Just hilarious how mad gopher fans were when miller said he was a late round pick. And he was right.","8004":"Probably. I wasn't able to watch a lot of our games this year unfortunately but Miller and Justin Watson were WR3\/4 before this pick. So assuming we keep 5 then he should be good","8005":"\ud83d\udc4d","8006":"Miller said he could be a UDFA and mentioned he had \u201ccharacter concerns\u201d that weren\u2019t substantiated in any way. That\u2019s why we hate him. Having a late round grade is fine, it\u2019s a super deep class and his athleticism is a major question mark. Making up that he has character concerns is bullshit.","8007":"Can\u2019t go wrong with OL depth","8008":"That's not KJ Hill","8009":"Backup center, nothing more","8010":"This guy was lightly recruited that earned a starting spot as a freshman and played vs Alabama in the semifinals.  He may be a career backup but he'll always compete.","8011":"Maybe Kiper was right? WE DID NEED A CENTER","8012":"This must be our backup plan after Tretter leaves 3 years from now.","8013":"ughhh really wanted him for the birds","8014":"Nice, we needed a backup behind Tretter.","8015":"Someone tell me how to feel","8016":"I just found out a player named A.J. Green is still available, 6th round grade. Comments going to be wild for that one \ud83d\udc40","8017":"Inception is great tho","8018":"I mean it ain\u2019t a kicker...","8019":"This guy sounds like a lineman","8020":"I think the guys on Cleveland Browns Daily radio mentioned him as a possible target around noon.  Good call.","8021":"I'll comment on the Pats pick here since it's locked. Classic Pats, draft some nobody kicker earlier than necessary.","8022":"How the fuck is he still on the board","8023":"I think you\u2019re wrong.  I think this is a great pick in the 5th round. Starter before year 3","8024":"Starter. Watch.","8025":"He was on scholarship, but UW was the only FBS offer he had out of high school.","8026":"Probably get a chance at guard as well in the meantime.","8027":"Me too","8028":"Mind if I ask why? I dont know a thing about this guy.","8029":"He either plays guard or is a depth pick.","8030":"He\u2019s good but small. Definitely has potential to be a starter.","8031":"Is Lamar Jackson still available too?","8032":"Not at center with Tretter there. I think he'll compete for the one open spot on the line at RG though. That line went from pretty garbage last season to pretty damn good. It only took signing the top free agent OT & using a top 10 pick on another lol.","8033":"Oh I totally misremembered that. I thought he got awarded one like Myles Bryant.  Undersized but hopefully he can have a nice career!","8034":"His number one NFL comp is Jason Kelce, who we absolutely love and who has been an amazing center for us.","8035":"He\u2019s very smart and quick in space. would\u2019ve fit in our scheme well. He\u2019s got similar traits to Kelce who has been contemplating retirement. I figured he would have slid in nicely whenever Kelce did decide to hang them up. I was surprised we didn\u2019t take him at the end of the fourth. \n\nI don\u2019t know enough about the browns to know how he\u2019ll do with them, but I suspect he\u2019ll be a productive player.","8036":"He is a 4 year starter at UW and played RG for half of that. Not the most physically imposing dude but he makes up for it with technique and a really great instinct for the game. Worked into a starting spot at guard as a true freshman on the 2016 playoff team and was a lock on the line the rest of his career.","8037":"Tim Brody is","8038":"Just saying, he will be starter at center. Watch.","8039":"I'll be very happy if this guy turns out nearly as good as Kelce.","8040":"We've got Tretter at centre and he looks good for a few more years if he can avoid injury, but it's always good to have a quality young player sitting below him. There's absolutely a space open at right guard though, if he's capable of throwing his name into the hat there.\n\nBy the way, how are you guys feeling about your draft up to this point?","8041":"I mean, if you're saying that and not without an injury, you have no idea who the starting center here is. Tretter is already a good player.","8042":"As a German I cant take his name seriously lmao. His name translated into English is \"pipe water\" lol","8043":"So just fuck Jake Fromm huh?","8044":"1ST KICKER DRAFTED EVERYONE GET IN HERE","8045":"THEY TOOK A KICKER BEFORE QB.","8046":"Of course Bill Belichick takes the first kicker in the draft.","8047":"Kim Jong Un died for this.","8048":"Imagine being Fromm right now lol","8049":"did jake fromm kill someone","8050":"Fucking lol Bill.","8051":"ITS A KICKER!!!!","8052":"That\u2019s not Goggles.","8053":"PATS GOT THE FUTURE OF THEIR FRANCHISE","8054":"This draft must be so comforting for Pats fans.

Something that the browns would do for years.","8383":"> You just explained why the patriots have a big need for QB. It's the most important position in football and you've got a total unknown.\n\nThen when a team drafts a QB in the 1st round, they should also draft a QB in every round, because if they needed a QB, they still have only an unknown so they need to keep drafting QBs. Your logic is shit. We might already have our solution at QB. We definitely don't have a solution at many other positions","8384":"That's what you think.

I mean, rightfully so, but - given the stakes in that exact moment - that kick was bonkers.  \n\nOf course next year in the SEC championship he missed a much easier kick that would\u2019ve put us up three scores...and we lost that game too.

You can get a kicker in the 7th or off the street.","8416":"Bill isn\u2019t gonna purchase that, he\u2019ll just put his rings in a summoning circle","8417":"And if he goes out and pulls a Nathan Peterman, you have...?","8418":"So knowing Boston area sports, how fast will the fandom turn on the organization when ya'll are terrible for 3-4 years?","8419":">We drafted Brady in the 6th round that one time and it worked so obviously that's all you need to do to get another great QB.\n\nPatriots fans *really* hate reality.","8420":"Just look at the comments and downvotes I got for daring to say 'maybe you should pick a QB before the 6th when all you have is a 4th round pick and a 35 year old journeyman at the most important position in sports'.

Might as well give Stidham the season if he's not the guy then it gets addressed next offseason.","8430":"Hoyer is there because he's a great scout team QB and he can teach younger guys, why the fuck would we get any other veteran QB available? They wouldn't be as good as Hoyer in the role we got Hoyer for. We'll probably draft someone else this year, but we are not in nearly as much of a rush to get a QB as people think. Almost every single player on our roster right now is shit or old. We are in a multi year rebuild. There is absolutely no reason to force a QB pick.\n\nAnd if you can just get a kicker in the 7th or off the street, there wouldn't be multiple teams (including Patriots last year) every year desparately cycling through kickers. Kickers are a lot harder to find than people think, and you generally can't justify having more than one so you have limited ability to try out kickers.","8431":"They would have a high draft pick next year where they can draft Fields or Lawrence","8432":"A draft in 2021","8433":"Trevor Lawrence","8434":"A lot of Boston sports teams were fucking terrible for a long time.

How are all the highly drafted qb's buffalo has taken?","8438":"Yeah Hot Rod put in fucking work that game, but that squib was a goddamned travesty","8439":"So the plan would be to throw an entire season of a great defense and one of Belichick's limited remaining years away for the chance at maybe getting someone you like next year?

How many superbowls does Buffalo have again?","8445":"I mean...yeah probably.

Stidham was a better prospect than fromm or any qb left on the board right now and they liked what they saw last year in preseason and practice so why not give him a shot?","8448":"They have an unproven 4th round QB, so what would be the point of drafting another unproven 4th round QB","8449":"The Patriots could have had many a QB other than Fromm at this point. And what it gives you is more than one chance to see if a QB can hack it as a starter. You're right, maybe both would crash and burn. But doubling those odds when your only other option would be a 35 year old Brian Hoyer is better than drafting a kicker that wasn't even seen as the top in the draft in the 5th round.","8450":"I literally just said Belichick could drag Nathan Peterman to a mediocre record, I'm not sure how that could possibly say he's a bad coach.

That's the only reason I can fathom him dropping this far.","8553":"This is the first year I've really watched draft coverage this closely but it seems like every pick is a \"steal\" and every team is quietly having a great draft, other than the Packers obviously. Is this an abnormally good draft class or is it the media\/fans being optimistic?","8554":"As a UVA fan I never really understood the \"slow\" narrative - he's bigger than most CBs but was usually one of the fastest players on the field both in terms of both top speed and acceleration. Part of why he was so good for us was his size combined with elite speed. We'll never know since he couldn't run because of the ankle, but I'd be shocked if he ran the 40 in over 4.5. \n\nHonestly I think he just looks \"slow\" because he's tall with longer legs so his feet aren't moving as fast, but he covers just as much ground.","8555":"That\u2019s kinda what happens though- they stop throwing to your man so you don\u2019t have a chance to rack up stats...","8556":"It\u2019s just the ankle.

A lot of teams are making very reasonable picks and filling needs. Many years have teams making odd reaches and taking players they have no need for.\n\n2. It is a deep draft. Many years end up being super top heavy where the first round looks like the only round with talent.\n\n3. The virus has made it easy for players to slip further than they might have because they couldnt get a physical and assure teams they will be fine.\n\nHowever you arent wrong that media\/fans always think they are getting starters even in the late rounds. But this year is definitely abnormal.","8563":"This draft class is really deep, specifically at WR, RB, and CB. People are probably over-hyping guys a little bit too but the draft class really is deep this year","8564":"In 2018, he ran the fastest in-game speed of any player in the country in the Miami game. So he's definitely not slow.","8565":"ARE","8566":"Ferguson","8567":"Morgan is the only one I was meh on, but once you start to get late into the fourth, I'm good taking risks. My biggest prob with him is I figure he'd prob be on the board later.","8568":"CHEATERS","8569":"Yeah 4-7 are mostly depth picks with that hopeful diamond in the rough. I don\u2019t mind taking a back-up, we need one and if we took a guy the Pats were high on it\u2019s icing on the cake. Davis just feels hard to justify. If he\u2019s a freak athlete who pans out into Mayes replacement and a better duo with Jamal awesome but we could\u2019ve grabbed another receiver in his spot","8570":"Official Jake Fromm watch: Ranked as the 54th overall prospect, he has now fallen over 100 picks.","8571":"WDE!","8572":"jaguars have taken, what? 4 DB's this draft?","8573":"Great pick. Daniel Thomas is a steal","8574":"What did Minshew do to this front office? They have all these picks and have only taken a fourth round project lineman and a receiver with injury issues so far. That is not how you help out your young QB, especially passing up on all of those high end prospects at tackle and receiver in the first round.","8575":"The draft ding-a-ling noise fit perfectly into Blinding Lights there.","8576":"Fromn would be a great fit in Jacksonville how bad can he possibly be?","8577":"Ravens get Calais Campbell, Jags get this guy. Seems fair.","8578":"He's a little slow for that height. But it's the Jags so someone who should be a practice body might end up getting serious snaps.","8579":"Wasted pick, we don\u2019t need a SS.","8580":"He\u2019s getting picked 199","8581":"Steelers?

So yes, we have decided not to draft a RB. We traded for one instead lol.","8721":"honestly we can always pick up a higher end RB next draft. This draft we are putting the framework for our team together by filling out the defense and Oline. Next draft we can utilize our picks to fill out our skill positions. And then we can push into win now mode for the next 2 years after that. I think an entire year of experience before entering win now is way more helpful for the defense and oline then it is for the WR and RB. Plus theirs a good chance Tua wont play a ton this year so the idea of those players growing with our new QB for a season is lessened a lot. \n\nPlus I imagine we will give some lower rated RB draft prospect a chance later in the draft to see if he can keep his spot on the team in the coming years or if he needs to be replaced. This will also help fill out our depth a bit, and utilize this next year for gaining experience.","8722":"We trade for them #BREIDA.\n\nPlus we can draft Etienne from Clemson next year. Tua isn\u2019t playing this year","8723":"Traded for breida","8724":"Yeah we flipped 153 for Breida. You get RBs for cheap in 2020.","8725":"I imagine they will use a 7th rounder on one as a camp body, long shot.

I like it","8774":"Breida was such a great rb. 49ers just have too much depth at rb.","8775":"you would think a Browns fan would understand the importance of OL Depth  lol","8776":"When your team identity is based on zone run scheme, and last season almost your entire offense of line dealt with some kind of injury, establishing depth on offensive line is wildly important","8777":"5th round is basically a 1st rounder for us.","8778":"And Greenlaw was a fifth round LB","8779":"I\u2019m sure ESPN would have told us that if that happened","8780":"Uhhh out of the loop here","8781":"Fromm probably killed their cousin","8782":"He's coming off a pretty nasty injury and teams can't get their own medicals on him, so it's not super surprising.","8783":"So Brunskill will probably start at RG","8784":"Like actually? Cuz if so then sick I'm happy with this. Still would prefer DBs but I guess the FO is really fucking confident with what we have since we haven't drafted a high DB in ages","8785":"i had him in one of my madden franchises and almost every single game he got injured and came back after 2 drives. Same thing with Phillip Lindsay","8786":"I\u2019m just glad we traded for a 5th round pick, that\u2019s our best round.","8787":"Uhh, the above comment wasn\u2019t editted","8788":"\"I prefer syrup\"\n\n*- John Lynch, probably*","8789":"How good is he? If the prophecy is fulfilled he will be good, most likely will play inside since he has short wingspan.","8790":"Surefire future HOFer","8791":"It\u2019s not about this year, it\u2019s about all of our corners being FAs after this year","8792":"Broke his leg halfway through this year, but that\u2019s the only injury I\u2019ve heard about","8793":"Thanks man! I love to hear it. Lynch tends to find good value in the 5th, so hope he's good!","8794":"I won\u2019t be surprised if we still take another by days end (Reggie Corbin perhaps)","8795":"Niners have hit well but it's still a crap shoot at this point on the whole.","8796":"Before the 2018 draft Guice was widely mocked inside the top 30 and quite a bit to the Lions. Inexplicably, he fell all the way to 59 to the Skins with the lions passing on him twice, thus everyone said he killed a guy","8797":"udfa","8798":"LG is Laken right? So Brunskill at RG, Tackles are Trent and McGlinchey, Center is Weston Richburg, barring injuries thats an insanely good OL.","8799":"Yea he played some guard in college. Teams where looking at him at tackle and guard.","8800":"Damn Madden getting super realistic.","8801":"Ya agreed. Hate to see Brieda go but we still have good depth and McKinnon should be back.","8802":"I swear I just saw \u201cI fucking John Lynch\u201d","8803":"Prolly raw, local honey, now I think on it. Dude takes his fitness seriously.","8804":"there is probably going to be re-signing and there is next year","8805":"Gotcha. So why is everyone so down for him","8806":"No this guy is obviously gonna be on Kittle and Greenlaw level. \u2018Tis the 5th rd prophecy","8807":"Still think Dobbins killed someone too lowkey, or fucked everyone\u2019s wife idk","8808":"Idk about Richburg yet because of his injury, so Ben Garland could start.","8809":"We're going to reunite Tevin Coleman and Devonta Freeman","8810":"You did. He did a ninja edit","8811":"Yeah I\u2019m not like devastated we didn\u2019t pick Hall lol, I just thought he should have been the pick","8812":"He\u2019s a big zone corner that, while obviously not as good as Sherman, plays a similar style to him","8813":"5th round prophecy and legacy.","8814":"This is the way","8815":"And pre-broken trent","8816":"Garland was a really solid replacement last year","8817":"THANK YOU. I\u2019m not crazy.","8818":"honestly im more worried about o line than cb when it comes to later picksi think ol hols better value  at this time of the draft than cb imo","8819":"After his god awful run in the first Seahawks game that is","8820":"Weird - I don\u2019t see the \u201cedit\u201d pencil mark\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/z0zdaho.jpg","8821":"Yeah this I definitely agree with. A late OL is almost always more likely to pan out than a late DB.","8822":"if u edit it fast enough i think within 2 or 3 minutes it doesn't show one lol","8823":"Good to know!","8824":"XFL REPRESENT","8825":"What a draft so far","8826":"I\u2019m fairly sure Rhule is never drafting an offensive player","8827":"Do we have to pay the mods to unlock the player?","8828":"KAW IS LAW!","8829":"Use his XFL picture you coward","8830":"ALL DEFENSE","8831":"KAW IS LAW PROUD OF YOU KENNY","8832":"Was he good in the XFL?","8833":"Panthers having a great draft","8834":"GIVE ME ALL YOUR DEFENSE.  \n  \nLove it.","8835":"XFL RISE UP!","8836":"XFL","8837":"XFL is not dead.","8838":"KA KAW","8839":"KAW KAW BABY","8840":"WVU fan here.

Building up a defense that needs help.","8868":"A NEW CHALLENGER APPROACHES","8869":"Really digging how the Panthers are shoring up the defense. Great draft so far","8870":"They got CMC, what more do you need?","8871":"Aside from OL, our offensive unit is pretty stacked. I'm okay with focusing on defense, it was horrific last year.","8872":"Well they did spend quite a bit of money on offense in free agency + CMC.","8873":"I'm okay with that. Offense is pretty much set for this season. Defense needs a lot of help, and we are trying to get it in this draft.","8874":"Frankly, we have good weapons on offense. CMC is CMC, we aren't taking a QB this draft and our WR group is top 10 in the league","8875":"Tight end would be the must justifiable pick and most of the good ones are gone.","8876":"Our defense was historically bad last year & we had a ton of FAs fuck off out the building, this is the right play.","8877":"We already have so many Wide receivers.","8878":"This is the EA virtual player they were talking about. It\u2019s just a loot box pack","8879":"Lol nice","8880":"KaKaw mutha Hubbard!","8881":"Can't blame you guys in that division","8882":"He was solid. You got a good one! Go battlehawks!","8883":"He was an absolute beast in the XFL.","8884":"Very","8885":"Had a case to be the best player in the league. For a guy that was too young to play in the NFL, that's pretty fucking good","8886":"Really really good","8887":"I know this man is gonna end up with a pick 6 early, he\u2019s always in the right place","8888":"Player X-FL","8889":"Him coming from the XFL means he flew under our radar as no mock drafts or big boards we looked at included him. That's the fun of day 3! We'll get him sorted for the final album we put in the hub.","8890":"!","8891":"500 touches!","8892":"We also just signed Robby Anderson to go with DJ Moore and Curtis Samuel. We fast as fuck","8893":"> Aside from OL\n\nWe'll just have our backup OTs play OG. That'll work out just fine, right guys? Guys?","8894":"Yeah, we got Teddy and a genuine WR1 to catch plus Samuel and Moore are both progressing nicely. Still a little worried about the O line but BPA is also a pretty big factor.","8895":"I wouldn't mind more help on the O line but I don't know if what is out there is worth drafting.","8896":"I'd like to take a late flier on Moss if he's there.","8897":"Works in NCAA 14 just saying.","8898":"I'd say Moore is our #1. He had almost 1200 yards with Allen at QB","8899":"> and a genuine WR1\n\nUh, what.\n\nYou think Moore isn't a genuine number 1? He had 84 yards per game with Kyle Allen\n\nAlso, Anderson is a quality contributor, but his career high is 940 yards, he isn't a \"legit number 1\"","8900":"Don't forget about PJ Walker!","8901":"Anderson is definitely not going to be our #1, but I agree offense is pretty well settled","8902":"I\u2019ve always heard that unless you draft one of the top 5 OL players in the draft, it\u2019s unlikely that you\u2019ll have an NFL ready player. OL takes time to develop. Hopefully the guys we drafted last year will make a jump forward for this year.","8903":"That would be so awesome","8904":"Rhule definitely wants to put points.","8905":"That's quite possible and our O line is not garbage it just needs some upgrades.","8906":"We could use a C prospect. Even if Paradis improves this year he's not likely to be around long-term.","8907":"I don't know if any decent ones are left.","8908":"Eagles gonna draft Kim Jong Un next lol","8909":"Chargers weapons look damn fine","8910":"Good pick. He can return too","8911":"Where do these facts come from? Lol","8912":"As a UVA fan, I'm happy for Joe! Shocked that he went before Bryce Hall, but he's a solid weapon. \n\nOne of the best KRs in FBS history (top-10 in career return yardage and TDs), and a pretty good reciever","8913":"Man is a stud- people know him as a returner but he\u2019s got the speed and hands to be a legit deep threat. All the UVA guys are way underrated this year.","8914":"Did teams just forget about Isaiah Hodgins and Donovan Peoples-Jones?","8915":"Someone tell me how to feel","8916":"Herbert is going to be having a party next year.","8917":"STEAL \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8","8918":"Herbert getting all sorts of weapons to hopefully succeed.","8919":"Looked up tape on this guy and you can't press him in a phone booth. He has speed but I think the main allure for him is his agility, looks like the WR equivalent of a chain mover.","8920":"30 rock reference","8921":"What makes this guy better than Johnson or Cephus? Does it mainly come from his return ability?","8922":"This draft has given me covid 19","8923":"He's literally dead now so ESPN will love the pick, at least.","8924":"Packers will draft his sister","8925":"We all know he\u2019s got a cannon","8926":"All I'm saying is look into it","8927":"This is plausible","8928":"Good because we need one.","8929":"They make them up every year- brilliant work as always- not sure which mod does it","8930":"The mods make them up, I kinda wish they'd be smaller and that stats be larger","8931":"My biggest question this draft lmao","8932":"Packers sure did","8933":"Peoples Jones isn\u2019t that good.","8934":"i went to high school with him, he was an absolute monster. you will most definitely be getting a solid kick returner at least. he\u2019s a big bodied receiver but kind of a sloppy route runner.","8935":"This is an awesome pick. He should be our new kick returner.","8936":"Wait what?","8937":"ESPN: \u201cOnce his father died he had to take over the family business.\u201d","8938":"Does king only return punts?","8939":"Are they real quotes or what lol","8940":"There's Easter eggs buried in them that nobody will notice","8941":"I think he\u2019s a bit overrated (he\u2019s not explosive at all), but he\u2019s got a large catch radius and definitely wasn\u2019t helped by Shea Patterson\n\nCould see him as a Jonnu Smith-type player in the right offense","8942":"He has really good measurables and Shea Patterson was fucking terrible. I figured he\u2019d be gone by now","8943":"He played well with Shea Patterson. I think he\u2019ll be a lot better with an actual qb. He\u2019s not great by any means","8944":"good thing he can learn from the best ;)","8945":"He's either in a vegetative state after heart surgery, or on a beach drinking mai tais.\n\nThese are both being reported lol","8946":"they put him on IR","8947":"He\u2019s in a vegetative state from a bad heart surgery","8948":"I believe he\u2019s done both. He was great at it in 2018 replacing Travis Benjamin, who was terrified of contact. Last year though, he muffed some punts along with some other mistakes. Wasn\u2019t nearly as good, it seemed like he was trying to do too much.","8949":"They are not real quotes, no","8950":"I want the lions to take him","8951":"Source?","8952":"So not \"literally dead\".","8953":"Yeah that surgeons family is not okay","8954":"I personally want Cephus, but I\u2019d be fine with him too","8955":"It's all over \/r\/news","8956":"literally me, google","8957":"FWIW TMZ is reporting that he's literally dead.","8958":"People have decided that the word literally doesn't actually mean literally anymore.

Lemieux is a decent technician with size and the potential to be a quick competitor in the NFL. At the point of attack, he is a real fighter, and as one source said, \"he is as mean as a snake.\" Some team sources like Lemiuex and think he could get selected on Day 2, while others have him as a mid-rounder. He is a polarizing prospect.\n\n>8\/17\/19: Lemieux has been a good left guard for Oregon over the past three seasons, making 38 straight starts over his collegiate career. He has been one of the top guards in the nation and Pac-12 during that time. In pass protection and run blocking, Lemieux is a well-balanced blocker who is productive in both phases. He redshirted as a freshman in 2015 prior to becoming a starter in 2016.\n\n[NFL.com scouting profile](https:\/\/www.nfl.com\/prospects\/shane-lemieux?id=32194c45-4d28-9885-7e91-71edd7d31c9a):\n\n>Strengths\n\n>* Well-proportioned with broad chest\n>* Prototype of a physical, blue-collar guard\n>* Team leader who leads by example\n>* Choppy settle steps ignite powerful charges into contact\n>* Brings his knockback power at impact\n>* As drive blocker, looks to push and sustain well beyond point of attack\n>* Uses upper-body strength to wrestle into favorable positioning\n>* Climbs up and smacks take-on linebackers with good jolt\n>* Works hard to mirror and slide with rushers\n>* Will reset hands and regain positioning against rush counters\n>* Has some recovery ability in pass pro\n\n>Weaknesses\n\n>* Arms are somewhat stubby for his size\n>* Pad level could be more consistent\n>* Takes time to run his feet under his hands\n>* Lacks lateral movement qualities to get to reach blocks consistently\n>* Base gets too wide in pass sets\n>* Punch placement can be erratic and off-target\n>* Over-sets against rush happy 3-techniques opening inside counter\n>* Gets gamed out of position by twists","8982":"Draft history.

I hope he has a lot of success in the league.","8991":"I love that we're emphasizing the big boys up front this draft!","8992":"Nice pick by the Giants! I consider this a steal.

OL who are good because of technique generally can learn new techniques.","9040":"He strictly played LG in college so I\u2019d be surprised if they moved him","9041":"Yeah I\u2019m an Oregon fan and you guys got a good one","9042":"So did I, but our only shot at him was 4.... I didn't want him that much.","9043":"Projected to play Center in the NFL, some people had him as a second rounder and PFF had him as the #3 guard","9044":"Lol jokes aside amazing draft by you guys","9045":"Like every player in this draft, an absolute steal.","9046":"My favourite thing about Chriss Ballard drafting, is how short we are on the clock for. Think it's cumulatively about 30 seconds across all our picks.","9047":"I wanted Eason and an Oline prospect today.

Only red flag with is injury is probably why he fell.","9070":"Nah bruh, we talking Testicle Tech here","9071":"No","9072":"Ball so hard university","9073":"Yeah, I mean that's what every GM should do. I like Ballard for his competence but at times I believe most GMs are really bad at drafting.","9074":"He's just there to fill in for when Big Q flexes to FB.","9075":"He only started playing tackle two years ago, so he\u2019s a bit raw. But he\u2019s got great lateral movement, has the build to play the position, and he has great awareness.

You said you've gotta Big Q?","9081":"Cuse fan here, Robinson would've been a round 3 pick last season, he faced double teams all this season with the loss of Chris Slayton to the NFL.","9082":"ONE OF THESE DAYS BRYCE HALL WILL BE OURS","9083":"I\u2019m liking the speed of these picks","9084":"He\u2019s a great project pick, surprised he lasted this long","9085":"Goodbye Trey Adams","9086":"Syracuse native here.  Seattle is going to love this guy.  Constantly causing problems in opponents backfields.","9087":"We like a D-Line pick","9088":"Payton looks ancient","9089":"He stole his girlfriend\u2019s purse TWICE!","9090":"Aww I wanted him","9091":"Don't know anything about this guy  Syracuse was not known for its defense last year","9092":"With that fun fact I\u2019m hoping he\u2019s got great footwork on the line","9093":"Nice ball of clay to play with.","9094":"No WR?","9095":"went to high school with the guy \ud83d\ude2d","9096":"ROCKET PRIDE BITCH","9097":"This feels like a better pick than their second rounder tbh. Great in tandem and I don't like that","9098":"I'm late to the party, but as an FSU fan, I hated his guy. You've got yourself a good one for a 5th rounder, Seattle!","9099":"Didn't he face felony charges for stealing stuff?","9100":"\"Nah\" - your GM","9101":"SPEAK IT INTO EXISTENCE","9102":"I mean, it'll probably be today or never. Not too many days to choose from.","9103":"I dont know how he keeps falling, but I'm really praying we can get him. He's gonna be way better than his draft position would indicate.","9104":"I figured he would get picked in the 5th, didn't expect him to be one of the first picks of the round though","9105":"Feel bad for him, at this point why not but his injury just killed his career","9106":"I really wanted him. No way he lasts. Too much upside","9107":"We needed linemen badly. Sounds pretty good.","9108":"we're in dire need of a pass rush, so pretty exciting for this.","9109":"Scouting report: fast around the edge, quick and strong hands","9110":"Rocket pride","9111":"Apparently his girlfriend\u2019s purse twice lol","9112":"Like 5 years ago","9113":"BRO IVE BEEN DOING THAT SINCE WEDNESDAY","9114":"Well we could sign him after his rookie contract is up 4 years from now. That or if the lions\/texans get him we can just trade for him after an all pro season for a bag of chips.","9115":"YESSIRRRR","9116":"Sorry","9117":"WOW","9118":"That was such a fast pick!","9119":"I got nothing to say here except that sometimes when I played beer pong in law school, sometimes instead of saying \"Kobe!\" I would say \"Kareem!\" and try to do the skyhook shot.\n\nIt never worked.","9120":"1 round down today 3 to go","9121":"Hell yeah! He should be a rock solid SDE for Cinci. Loved him at ND.","9122":"Can he play offensive line?","9123":"Over Weaver and Anae? Hmmm","9124":"Not sure how I feel about that","9125":"Dude is good at containing the outside on run plays. Not great at pass rush, but that can be taught. He's got good instincts, so I think this is a pretty good pick.","9126":"Jesus he\u2019s got some long arms","9127":"I'm not saying this is a bad pick, but my cousin dominated him when they played against each other in HS. And my cousin was not good enough to play CFB.","9128":"If we were gonna waste a pick it should have been Moss","9129":"Lol, at some point things are going to have to speed up","9130":"Coaches have said they\u2019re ok with the moves made on the line (Johnson and sua  filo) guess they weren\u2019t lying","9131":"He is a decent pick for R5 though. Some decent DE development prospects still on the board. I thought Anae had already gone to be honest.","9132":"He was pretty damn good in college, too.","9133":"Your cousin should have played CFB because Kareem dominated most of the lineman he went up against.","9134":"Nah. He'll be a undrafted free agent.","9135":"With how much we rotate our DL I wouldn't say this is a wasted pick. Im willing to trust the process right now. Maybe not ideal with some OL left, but we'll see","9136":"I don\u2019t understand our subs fascination with Moss","9137":"Watch the tape","9138":"What else is anybody gonna do lol","9139":"Remember that dude in \/r\/Bengals who received a handwritten letter from Brown saying we were wanting to focus on the front 7? I guess it was legit.","9140":"I'm not unhappy with it, we rotate our DL a ton so more fresh legs, especially at this point in the draft, is a plus. Need to learn more about him.","9141":"He didn't have the size. No college wants a 5'11\" guy on their OL.","9142":"Ya we killed picks 1-4 so I trust what they are doing","9143":"Oof","9144":"Strong, physical player. Holds his own well in the run, lacks traditional explosion. High IQ player. Lacks big-time pass-rush moves, but does a solid job of reading the OT and times his bull rushes well.\n\nI think it's a very solid pick. EDGE was definitely a low-key need for us.","9145":"https:\/\/thedraftnetwork.com\/player\/khalid-kareem\/lEz23h2mEg\n\nI had him in a mock for us. All meaningless obviously but sounds good for R5 on here.","9146":"Agreed on EDGE being a need, I was kinda hoping Weaver or Anae here, but I'm willing to trust the staff right now","9147":"They're all fairly different players. I question if Anae is going to be able to play consistently with his hand on the ground. He's more of a stand-up, IMO. I know we're talking about the hybrid defense, but I think Weaver and Kareem are a more natural fit for our scheme.\n\nWeaver and Kareem are similar athletes. Lack top-level explosion that you typically see in an EDGE. Kareem is much stronger against the run and holding the edge. Given our issues in run defense, I'm not surprised at all that the coaches went that direction.","9148":"Ahh okay good to know, thanks! Makes me like it more.","9149":"Once again, we want to thank [sportsreference.com](https:\/\/www.sports-reference.com\/), who have provided most of the stats you see today and this weekend.

Gonna be a stud","9273":"Nah, that\u2019s because incompetent coaching","9274":"Yeah you right. The eagles are way better at drafting they just have the better mindset\n\n\nThey know they can only win with a backup qb so they went out and drafted a good one.

Basically it seemed like it broke him as a player (compared to how good he was) so although he\u2019s still technically sound he doesn\u2019t have the athleticism now","9286":"This ain\u2019t it.","9287":"Yup same reason Frederick went 31 when, looking back, he was easily like a top 2 player that draft. Hopkins is the only guy I see in the convo.","9288":"Perhaps I\u2019m less interested since my guys have no picks left\n\nWhereas your team on the other hand... lol the Vikes are loaded this draft","9289":"Hope you like kickers in the 4th.","9290":"Clap man gone now. He can't hurt us anymore","9291":"1. Jordan Love\n\n2. Jalen Hurts\n\nEnd of List","9292":"Love and hurts in round 1\/2 respectively","9293":"Considering Biadasz was projected mid-2nd before he got injured, yeah I'd call him a steal","9294":"Seriously every thread has \"oh my God such a great pick,  what a steal\".\n\nAt what point do the police get called for all this thievery","9295":"It seems like 140 guys would have gone in the 1st round if it wasnt for that one minor injury issue","9296":"Hurts in the 2nd","9297":"Every player the average fan has heard of is a steal if taken after the third round","9298":"About 95% of picks are steals according to \/r\/nfl","9299":"Jalen Reagor. That dude the Giants reached for in the 1st when they could've gotten Isaiah Simmons.","9300":"Not wise to bet against a Wisconsin OL succeeding in the NFL","9301":"RemindMe! 3 years","9302":"He probably will. It\u2019s a Wisconsin offensive lineman.","9303":"For a 4th rounder I\u2019d be happy if he ends up just being a solid backup.","9304":"I hear you're an all world bottom.","9305":"His hip surgery caused most of his issues imo. He should be fully healed and ready to go","9306":"We're literally starting a 4th rounder at QB.\n\nAnd he's good enough we didn't spend a 2nd rounder on his back up.","9307":"He was projected to go in the first before injuries","9308":"In our defense, Kelce was a 6th round pick.","9309":"he only fell this far because of injury. last year and the start of this year he was top 3 interior linemen in this class easily","9310":"You do realize 4th round picks have been very successful in the NFL, right?","9311":"He was a 1st round talent and then had hip surgery which dropped his play this year.  If he's fully healthy he was the best offensive lineman this class.","9312":"He was a unanimous All-American and won the Rimington Trophy for the best Center in CFB. You get a grip","9313":"Who knows. I wanted him with our 3rd","9314":"I'm pretty sure Seumalo is the Kelce replacement","9315":"Looney is perfectly serviceable in the interim","9316":"We all know how this is gonna turn out. \u201cTIL the cowboys drafted their HOF C after trading up with the Eagles. The Eagles would use their pick on a punter that was cut 2 years later\u201d","9317":"Yeah he's definitely a project center. \n\nBoth of Dallas's 4th rounders are big athletes who have shown aptitude but either are extremely raw (CB from Tulsa) or are dealing with an injury (this center from Wiscy). \n\nGood news for us is that there's plenty of reason to believe Philbin will be able to develop him into a solid OL in a year or two.","9318":"Exactly","9319":"Medicals are questionable but clearly the Cowboys are ok with them to trade up for him","9320":"Nations best center and unanimous all american","9321":"And we have no need to rush him back. Let him redshirt!","9322":"Maybe it's just injured linebackers now that I think of it,\n\nSean Lee\nJaylon Smith\nLVE\n\nAll banged up prior to the draft. I can't really think of any other notable ones (aside from that guy with Sickle Cell disease)","9323":"Nah, he was pretty bad this year, if you get the version of him that played this past year, he's a backup at best. There's a reason he was available here.","9324":"Shh let them believe it","9325":"Those bastards!","9326":"I'm concerned that we haven't taken an edge yet but I'd definitely love Fromm if we got the chance at the end of this round","9327":"Lol, you accidentally typed \u201cRedskins.\u201d","9328":"I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s their turn to win the division.","9329":"Must be frustraing having a good draft at the same time as divisional rivals.","9330":"We just replaced Antoine Bethea with the best safety in the draft and replaced renters with the best OT in the draft. Then got an athletic freak who allowed 7 pressures all year and graded well against the run. Followed by an athletic CB. Now I\u2019m just going to ignore the cowboys picks, to include this one, when I tell you this but they\u2019re doing terrible","9331":"In our division the Eagles and Cowboys know how to build their OLs, I\u2019d guess the value here was worth the risk, and happened to fit a need, especially given their potential slam dunk start to the draft","9332":"He had surgery though which (hopefully) fixed it.","9333":"Time to draft a bunch of hopefully depth players! Which we actually kinda need","9334":"*LOVE HURTS*","9335":"I would say there's definitely a lot of athletes in this draft who are held back by red flags. Terrell Lewis is a great example of this year. Raw talent, but clear red flags. \n\nOn top of that the draft really is deep with day 2 talent, meaning that there's plenty of gems falling into the 3rd day. \n\nNo guarantee any of these guys work out, still.","9336":"That's all-pro power bottom to you!","9337":"If the NFL truly believed that he would have been picked earlier","9338":"Zing.","9339":"4th round QB who won rookie of the year over 2nd overall pick Carson Wentz","9340":"jesus... that person has feelings lol\n\nhttps:\/\/i.imgur.com\/GnZWpYG.jpg","9341":"I think the Eagles just wanted to have two QBs who are better than Dak (Wentz and probably Hurts)","9342":"So was Matt Barkley","9343":"Yeah and Brady was a 6th. Doesn't mean I expect everyone to be that good.","9344":"Almost like they didn\u2019t want the guy and thus fired on the trade. Huh","9345":"In our defense, we are awesome at drafting and developing OL and we could use a center and we just let him go to a rival. \n\nSo we probably didnt think that highly of him","9346":"You do realize they\u2019re usually the exception rather than the norm, right? Do you expect every 6th round QB to be the GOAT since Brady is too?","9347":"I forgot Redditors know more about drafting than actual GMs my bad.","9348":"Just like the trade in 2010 that got us Sean Lee and you guys got...I dont remember","9349":"Yeah my expectation is both of them are going to be at least 3 years out before they show any starter ability. But on day 3 you're looking for diamonds in the rough, we're well past where you find starting contributors unless you strike gold.","9350":"No he wasnt lol","9351":"eh, this draft has surplus of talent, we all eatin fam \n\n(minus phily HAHAHAHAHA)","9352":"And now three fourth rounders next year. Yall bout to draft the whole class","9353":"Eagles QB depth charts reads: Wentz Hurts","9354":"OOF\n\n\n\nthis is the one","9355":"Yeah yeah","9356":"*Looooove Scaaars*","9357":"It happened with DK just last year","9358":"I mean it happens every year","9359":"Eh Centers are pretty undervauled in the NFL compared to most positions. Especially with this draft being deep at skill positions.","9360":"Not true. Lots of guys fall significantly, even completely out of the draft, because of injury concerns.","9361":"We got La\u2019el Collins, a first round talent very late too. Things happen but you know the talent was there","9362":"Rings, Ernie.","9363":"By what metric is either of them better than Dak? Please enlighten us.","9364":"True, but Dallas has been good at drafting the past 5 years. Eagles really haven't.","9365":"In our defense, Dallas has been just as good if not better at OL talent evaluation and development, and you just let us grab a center from Wisconsin for a 2021 5th.","9366":"Lol I literally just listed the accolades he won. Not to mention the track record of Wisconsin offensive lineman","9367":"Probably like Nate Allen or some useless shit. And damn I didn\u2019t realize Sean Lee was that old.","9368":"Exactly. Day 3 you're looking for just above replacement level\/players who won't be liabilities. Day 3 is for getting the Jarwins, Awuzies, and Maliek Collins of the world. Solid non-stars who could possibly play through a second contract. \n\nWe don't need Biadasz to be Frederick, we just need him to be ready in 2-3 years when Looney\/Mcgovern leave and he has to become the center. \n\nSame with the CB in the 4th. He'll be a CB3 at best, and if we really get lucky his talent will lift him to a CB2 for a year or so. Diggs is the CB1 talent.","9369":"Ok, I guess every team in the NFL just decided to let him fall from the 1st to the bottom of the 4th round for fun.","9370":"Lol fuck philly","9371":"Did DK fall solely because of injury concerns? Or the 3 cone? Or lack of diverse route tree? Think it was more of a combination of the three rather than solely injury","9372":"La\u2019el was 1st round grade, and went undrafted bc of a rumor lol. We had elite guard play the last 3 years at the league minimum.","9373":"Collins did not fall because of injury concerns. That\u2019s totally different","9374":"He wasn't even drafted too","9375":"Not even close to the same scenario","9376":"Ah, right. I forgot about all of those playoff games that Wentz won for you.","9377":"such a ridiculous playoff run by wentz, ill never forget it","9378":"This might be the dumbest argument I've ever seen out of someone on the internet. That's crazy.","9379":"You might want to check their past 5 drafts compared to ours. 2016 was good for them but outside of that, pretty pedestrian.","9380":"We'll see which FO OL evaluation is better than","9381":"I don\u2019t give a shit lol nearly everyone drafted, especially in the early rounds, have tons of accolades. Do you really think if this guy is projected to be a perennial pro bowler he would be drafted at the end of the 4th round","9382":"I really liked Nate Allen as a prospect but as soon as he went the the Eagles it was \u201cfuck em\u201d lol","9383":"You do realize Chidobe Awuzie was a 2nd round pick, right?","9384":"Personally I still think Ruiz was the round 1 pick, he's going to be an absolute stud and would've made Zeke even more terrifying than he already is with how well he can pull and set up blocks on the second level.","9385":"Because hip surgery is fucking scary","9386":"Dilly dilly...","9387":"Neck injury, paired with being the less productive Ole Miss WR","9388":"He fell because his girlfriend got murdered and it was pretty obvious he wasn't involved. That had to have the dumbest reason for a fall I've ever seen.","9389":"We don\u2019t get the 1 seed we don\u2019t get to the super bowl. That\u2019s a fact jack.","9390":"That\u2019s hyperbole and you know it. You never saw those two dudes debating number of days in a week on that bodybuilding.com forum? Also a meme barely qualifies as an argument lmao, chill","9391":"3 starters in the secondary from 2017. LVE, Williams, and Gallup from 2018. The Amari trade and Pollard look damn good already from 2019 and both McGovern and Wilson show good promise. One of the GOAT drafts in 2016.\n\nI think we're doing just fine.","9392":"Umm... I think you're mistaken.","9393":"I mean we don't need to wait, it's pretty clear I'd say. I still can't believe you just gave us a center from Wisconsin for a future 5th...Like even if he doesn't pan out, I don't see the logic at all.","9394":"Bruh what the fuck are you saying? Show me on the doll where Tyler Biadasz hurt you","9395":"He meant a different awuzie","9396":"I got him and Jourdan Lewis mixed up.","9397":"I think you could be right, but I think Lamb will be a star so I'm not mad at all about getting a WR who won't disappear in big games.","9398":"Wasn't the surgery before last year? If he hadn't looked bad after it, they wouldn't have cared.","9399":"Lol you guys are resorting to making jokes about our super bowl win and thinking it\u2019s shit talking","9400":"Meanwhile they've picked up some good picks like Dillard and Hicks, but largely they've been poor at drafting, notably in WR.","9401":"It's clear before he plays an NFL snap?","9402":"Yeah it's basically getting a luxury player now with a rough year next year. We'll see how it works out. It's hard to pass up on Lamb at that point but it certainly leaves a lot less wiggle room in 2021\/2022. I also think it's going to be hard to match the production Cobb did as a 3rd wide receiver (850 yards behind 2 1000 yard receiver is not a common occurence), especially in a likely shortened offseason. So they really need him to catch on immediately.","9403":"I could be missing someone but Barnett looks like their best pick since 2017 so far and he's good, but not great.","9404":"You've missed quite of few good picks there, my dude.","9405":"It's clear that our Oline evaluation has been top tier for many years now.","9406":"He's played both inside and outside at OU and was used in jet sweep type plays and routes. I think he'll fit into that role instantly. I honestly bet he'll be the #2 WR sooner than people think.","9407":"Dillard is likely going to be their best pick for a while. Dude looks like a stud.","9408":"Okay name them. Aside from Wentz, Vaitai, and Hicks, name some people you'd re-draft given the opportunity.","9409":"And ours hasn't lmfao","9410":"Fair enough. Olinemen are hard to judge without watching them a lot.","9411":"I'll help out. Miles Sanders is looking like a great pick. Still doesn't really bring them close to the Cowboys imo","9412":"*SpongeBob graphic*\n\nOne hour later....","9413":"When you draft 3 all-pros in one decade let me know.","9414":"Very true. I've seen most of the Eagles games last year, and Dillard seems legit, so does Sanders.","9415":"Okay champ","9416":"Kelce and Johnson are two. And we did sign Brandon Brooks so while not drafting there's 3.","9417":"Fucking dirty O'Driscoll","9418":"##THOSE DAMN O'DRISCOLLS","9419":"I thought she said Jeff Driskel","9420":"Kid had more energy in that clip than Gooddell had in the past two days combined","9421":"He was still available??!!","9422":"Damn O'Driscoll","9423":"Vaitai replacement let\u2019s go!","9424":"Yeesh","9425":"Man how much crack did that kid do","9426":"BR is roasting this guy","9427":"WDE","9428":"Should have went with Samarth.","9429":"O Driscoll","9430":"Surprised he got picked before Prince Tega from Auburn.  He's solid but not the best lineman Auburn had","9431":"That kid is the only happy eagles fan left.","9432":"Sammarth.","9433":"Are teams just not trading anymore?\n\nLol","9434":"GOD DAMN O'DRISCOLL","9435":"\"Colm O'Drisoll... \"","9436":"King Kong reference","9437":"###FINALLY SOME LOGIC","9438":"\u201cJa..\u201d really thought they about to take Jake Fromm","9439":"guards rise up","9440":"Damn. Wanted him at 147 for the Bengals.","9441":"What cowboys traded up!","9442":"Great pick","9443":"Screams internally with every interior olineman that gets drafted","9444":"Solid, I was thinking Higby in the 5th was their IOL target but Driscoll is probably a better fit as he plays similarly to Kelce","9445":"Good addition from the Eagles. Dude can block for Hurt.","9446":"Good pick?","9447":"Finally some protection for Hurts. Gotta invest in your franchise guy.","9448":"Let's go Hand Tigers","9449":"But that\u2019s not a QB","9450":"Just have some Goddamn faith","9451":"TAHITI","9452":"I HAVE A PLAN","9453":"Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s crack, can\u2019t be putting on excess weight with all the sugar.","9454":"Roger\u2019s batteries were low","9455":"Of all the Auburn players, I am more shocked that Prince Tega Wanogho is still out there.","9456":"Either that or he could compete inside with Seumalo, I like the pick. Slot him in everywhere.","9457":"PFF really loved him for a long time.","9458":"Yeah I\u2019m watching them talk about him too, saying he has no movement skills and that he was around the 215th best prospect.","9459":"Well, there you go.","9460":"Less reason to now in the later rounds.  You're trying to get backups and competition guys.  So most teams don't want to trade up and lose their later picks.\n   \nEDIT:  And then immediately there's a trade.","9461":"As if on cue...","9462":"You spoke too soon","9463":"Too much of a hazzle when you're not in the same room to communicate.","9464":"SO DID WE","9465":"I have no faith when they take Hurts","9466":"Mangoes, Orthur","9467":"ONE.

Payback","9493":"This guy has potential to be really good. \n\nGreat pick by Seattle.","9494":"The headline confused me. \n\nDallas Miami Seattle. \n\nGot it. Hes a seahawk","9495":"Absolutely love this pick, he was the only player providing life to the Hurricanes offense","9496":"Sad to see the first University of Miami guys going in the 4th round...","9497":"Checks name. Training camp hype train confirmed.","9498":"Two consecutive years taking a Miami RB, interesting.","9499":"What a shame - DeeJay Dallas isn't on the Cowboys and Ezra Cleveland isn't on the Browns.","9500":"ESPN just straight not doing analysis on like 40% of these picks.","9501":"Classic Seahawks pick","9502":"Now that's a name!","9503":"Loved him in Super Street Fighter II.","9504":"Finally there's the running back, was worried the Seahawks were losing their identity","9505":"I wanted him just because of name association haha","9506":"Great receiver out of the backfield.","9507":"Back to back years taking an RB from the U! Carrol and that staff definitely like how our backs run the rock.","9508":"This guy was about the only fun part of Miami's offense this past season, you got a good one Seattle","9509":"I feel like we have so many more pressing needs","9510":"Huh. He's solid but man the Hawks just love drafting RBs when hey have bigger needs huh.","9511":"Why??","9512":"Cmon mannnnn","9513":"Of course we took an RB","9514":"Seattle picked a 4th string RB bad 4th string TE in round 4.","9515":"Seriously! Coulda had Tyler Biadasz also!","9516":"No the Broncos are going to draft him. We'll combine him with Bryce Callahan to have a singular healthy CB named Bryce.","9517":"Shhh let him fall to 210","9518":"Sounds like he does porn on the side","9519":"\ud83c\udfa7 \u272d","9520":"Sounds like the name of Captain America in one of the reboots.","9521":"Dallas from Georgia played college ball in Miami and is going to Seattle.","9522":"His theme immediately started playing in my head when I heard this guy's name.","9523":"I\u2019m shocked you are shocked. The NFL has some of the weirdest names in sports.","9524":"I wish it was DeeJay McDallas.","9525":"It's not, but that doesn't really matter.","9526":"Yeah when all your RBs go down with a month left in the season that\u2019s what happens. Not to mention our TEs going down.","9527":"We actually desperately need a running back. Penny will be put a while, maybe the whole season. Carson broke his arm but is in the last year of his deal and could hold out and really rake us over if we didn\u2019t have insurance. Otherwise I Travis homer and we know how that went.","9528":"If you draft all the running backs, you literally can't lose.","9529":"Seahawks rarely draft UW prospects oddly enough, tho Dissly has been fantastic when healthy","9530":"Eh we probably need a RB we have approximately 1 that is currently healthy","9531":"DeeJay Dallas\n\n\n\nAnother One","9532":"Kiper is extremely high on Adams fwiw, I\u2019ve seen him more as a 6th or 7th.

Who would\u2019ve thought a UCF player would go first","9552":"If we don\u2019t resign Carson it\u2019s a need so I think it\u2019s better to address it now then later","9553":"This was a huge need.","9554":"Both our RBs were injured and we had to play Marshawn in the playoffs, that\u2019s probably why.","9555":"At least its the 4th and not the 2nd","9556":"Carson and Penny probably won\u2019t be ready by camp (whenever that is)","9557":"Some good O-Line still there, hell even Bryce Hall woulda been nice.","9558":"Ive wanted Bryce Hall since the second round and Jon Taylor was gone. I need this.","9559":"I'm sorry, we needed another Wisconsin Center","9560":"Tyler Biadez honestly would have been a waste of a pick","9561":"Fall to 148 pls","9562":"Or EDM?","9563":"Sounds like he does football on the side lol","9564":"That's Jerruhs pornhub account","9565":"not to mention how critical those last 4 games of the year were for our playoff berth & seeding.","9566":"Typical ACL recovery time puts Penny back for an early season return and players can't hold out anymore under the new CBA. We still did need a back tho, rather not pay Carson 10M in a year","9567":"The last couple years, they keep going first round.\n\nAnd Kearse, BBK, Dissly were all UW.\n\nOther UW products in the league are Shelton, Vita Vea, Desmond Trufant, John Ross, ASJ*, Dante Pettis, Myles Gaskin, Budda Baker.\n\nThat's not a bad showing for star vs home team talent.","9568":"nah Deejay is a phenomal blocker, our Oline as a whole was just shit, so he can't block the 3rd and 4th guy to rip through. Also Enos didn't call enough plays with Deejay in the backfield to help protect because he actually really is a great blocker","9569":"He's a strong runner","9570":"He carried Miami's offense","9571":"Somebody broke into my Toyota Carolla and stole a bunch of CD's back in the early 2000s.  Never new who did it, but from now on I'm blaming Jerry Jones.","9572":"God he's so good","9573":"And Fiu, and fau","9574":"Wait is this true...? As in, we're not sure if he will start the year?","9575":"Fuck me god damnit","9576":"How so?","9577":"WELL HE DID","9578":"There's no guarantee Penny is coming back 100 percent, ACL tears take at least two years to fully mentally recover.","9579":"I guess i watched different games than you did. Our line was dogshit but DeeJay was frequently a turnstile next to whoever the QB of the month was. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t actively terrible, I guess. But phenomenal is just a silly thing to say.","9580":"The real Florida powerhouses","9581":"I believe they should be ready week 1, but both are coming off pretty bad injuries and probably won\u2019t be available for the preseason.","9582":"It's true there's no guarantee physically but where's mentally coming from? There's a ton of players post Peterson that tore their ACL and came back like nothing happened.","9583":"Also have to keep in mind he didn't just tear his ACL. I don't know the exact details but Pete has confirmed he suffered additional damage to the knee besides his ACL. That's a brutal injury to recover from, especially considering it was sustained towards the end of the regular season.","9584":"Gotcha, thanks","9585":"Oh boy, more guards!","9586":"From one Harbaugh to the next","9587":"I'll never say no to IOL depth","9588":"Another Ben on the line! Lets work on getting a whole line of Bens","9589":"Death, taxes, and Ravens taking linemen in later rounds","9590":"He will get typecast as a runblocker by many analysts. He has legit chops as a pass protector. Pff pass blocking grade of 88.7. Great value.","9591":"Ravens having the best draft. By not over thinking things.","9592":"Great pickup by the ravens. Bredeson was a second team all American at guard and I think the best player on the Michigan offensive line this past season","9593":"\ud83e\udd80 g u a r d \ud83e\udd80","9594":"Solid guard. From Harbaugh to another.","9595":"What the hell are these stats?","9596":"The entire AFC North is killing it and I don't like it","9597":"Great pick. Baltimore having the best draft.","9598":"This guy is going to be starter in the NFL. Would have took him in round 3.","9599":"This dude is just a flat out a beast. He looks like one of those guards from the 90s.","9600":"I\u2019m not mad, but I wanted EDGE or Biadasz. I\u2019ll trust our front office.","9601":"Go blue baby!","9602":"Good job neighbor!","9603":"He\u2019ll be good depth for you guys","9604":"He has photographic memory...","9605":"People should be (even more) terrified of our running game. We already had the best run game in forever and we just got another incredible back that could be someone like a shiftier gus. If put OL holes can be managed, this is going to be another fun year to watch.","9606":"Get all the guards","9607":"I smell collusion.","9608":"Ever thought about working for the Vikings? Could use some of that big brain thinking right about now","9609":"Not to mention we barely had any","9610":"A long lineage of Ben linemen.\n\nGrubbs, Powers, Bredeson...","9611":"Lotta Bs in general. Bradley Bozeman, Orlando Brown, Ben Powers, Ben Bredeson.","9612":"We\u2019ll trade you Roethlisberger and Snell for Lamar and Ingram straight up if you want to go even farther","9613":"If you could start fucking up drafts please, that be great. I feel like we are finally doing OK and you keep being well run and keeping ahead.\n\nI really liked this guy for us to push for RG.","9614":"They have this ridiculous complicated formula for their picks. It's hard to get your head around, but what they do is this: they wait until their pick, and then they take a really good player that makes their team better.","9615":"Also a four year starter and two year captain","9616":"He only participated in the eating portion of the combine","9617":"Ugh burrow could be a pain in the ass for a while and the browns secondary could be scary now. I'm hoping this is just another year where the browns look like offseason Champs and end up the same old browns.","9618":"lol","9619":"This edge thing is concerning.","9620":"Just try and stop our run game now!","9621":"Fake news","9622":"*Ruxin has entered the chat*","9623":"Nahh it's just silly to have more than 2 OGs on your roster, you  can only start 2 anyways.

Plus with Ozzie still consulting for drafts, we still have one of the best ever helping out behind the scenes. Rounds 1-3 rarely are even that significant for us anyway. We always manage to find some little-known player that quickly turns into a stud which we usually end up trading to someone who pays him a lot giving us another 3rd round comp pick, starting the whole cycle over again. \n\nActually, I think the absolute most important thing that allows us to draft so well is the fact that we almost never give up picks to trade up for someone and always trade back to grab some more late round picks (which we have very good success in turning into an impact player).  Ozzie is hands down one of the best drafters of all time and we were lucky enough to have EDC studying under him for over a decade. I really do feel bad for fans of teams that are constantly stuck in the \"win right now\" mode and aren't able to enact some sort of plan for long term consistent success.\n\nPlus, the fact that we ended up with Lamar (who was one of the extremely rare picks we actually traded up for) looks absolutely fucking insane knowing what we do now.\n\nSorry for the rant btw.","9630":"And arm length.","9631":"I am an idiot, but also unintentionally right as he is from Wisconsin","9632":"The FO is just banking on either bowser or ferguson playing to their potential.

Don't know much about him, but we needed a big target.","9670":"Good for him, living his dream of getting drafted despite not going to an actual college","9671":"Rip was hoping Detroit could get him next pick","9672":"God fucking damnit","9673":"Is claypool dead?","9674":"Offseason champs returning to form","9675":"Babytron!","9676":"Y'all got the better prospect version of him in Pittman anyways","9677":"Yep...","9678":"This is an actual steal","9679":"Or at least the nicknames should be good","9680":"Pretty decent. A lot of upside and not a risky pick where they got him. Some may even say he slid a bit","9681":"Kid is lightning in cleats. Him and Scary Terry are going to be fun to watch.","9682":"Steal","9683":"Great pick. A lot of receivers were drafted ahead of them that, frankly, shouldn\u2019t have been","9684":"I'm beyond pissed you guys got him. I looove this kid. Played against questionable competition, but absolutely dominated it","9685":"He's so long. Great downfield possession guy, he's no megatron but he's the kinda guy that will help Haskins' development alot","9686":"He's fantastic","9687":"I\u2019m going to go against the grain and say: wary. Dominant small school receiver with slightly disappointing athletic testing who really struggled at the senior bowl against D1 competition. Senior bowl coaches saw enough of him early on and limited his reps in favor of other WRs. I was quite excited about him as a prospect cause I love some small school receivers, but he may see some big struggles adjusting to the level of competition.","9688":"Honestly, IDK I was watching tape last night and he was dominant but you can tell the level of competition he faced was garbage.","9689":"I really wanted this kid. Small school obviously but he looks like he belongs playing on sundays","9690":"Good","9691":"Can't believe TAMU didn't recruit him","9692":"Yeah you know me.","9693":"Ah Shhyt, Piss, PISSS IN MY ASSS","9694":"How about the Redskins trade him to the Cowboys for Lamb?","9695":"Based strictly off his name, yes.","9696":"Yes. Very","9697":"Yes","9698":"He\u2019s a \u201cgets bodied by smaller LBs over the middle but will catch in triple coverage on a 40 yard post\u201d guy. So he\u2019ll make a great redskin. I could easily see him being your top red zone receiver this year","9699":"Problem now is protecting him. The weapons are there with Terry, AGG, and the kid from Memphis who\u2019s name is escaping me at the moment. A lot of home run threats that can allow Haskins to try and do less and just get his guys the ball in space and go to work.","9700":"Depending on how Bryant looks for us early I won\u2019t be shocked if Njoku can be had for a 4th or a 5th sometime during the season.","9701":"well we took another WR before him so i think Mcbeane didn't rate him that highly","9702":"rofl, whats wrong with liberty?","9703":"I think we could use speed more than size at WR","9704":"Steelers drafted him","9705":"Bruh! You sleep all evening yesterday? lol","9706":"All we need to do is sign MBC to a huge contract and we'll be the official offseason champs","9707":"A proper purloin","9708":"ALL THE SPEEDY BOIS","9709":"Apparently he also did pretty well when they faced a few good defenses like UVA.","9710":"Yeah, definitely a nice \u201che\u2019s down there somewhere\u201d fuck it and chuck it guy for Haskins","9711":"Throw in scary terry and your first and second round pick next year and you\u2019ve got yourself a deal partner\n\nedit: this was just a joke lol","9712":"They drafted a promising LT in Saahdiq Charles","9713":"Yeah, I'm happy with Davis but everyone's got their personal faves","9714":"Jerry fucking Falwell Jr., that's what.","9715":"They\u2019re hardcore religious creationists, anti-evolution courses and all that crazy stuff.","9716":"Oh I must've missed that. When?","9717":"Legit Larceny.","9718":"I watched his UVA game and didn't think it was his best. Not a bad game by any means but nothing phenomenal. He played against Syracuse (when they were ranked at 22) and completely dominated them. His game against Buffalo was one of the most dominant games I watched by any wr prospect this year","9719":"He put up 192 yards & 2 TDs when Liberty beat Baylor out of nowhere.","9720":"If we throw Scary Terry that would mean you would owe us your first and second pick next year.","9721":"You don\u2019t deserve the downvotes. I thought the sarcasm was pretty obvious","9722":"Yeah if he can keep his head on straight he\u2019s an awesome pick up at that draft spot","9723":"New center too","9724":"2nd round","9725":"R2","9726":"Yesterday, 2nd round I think","9727":"Terry is better than Amari and this dude wants us to send firsts for Lamb \ud83d\ude02","9728":"most redditors cant read social queues","9729":"His coach vouched for him, and he admitted he made mistakes and that he\u2019s committed to not making them again.","9730":"Huh I really don't know how they flew past me","9731":"I wouldn't say he's better than Amari rn.","9732":"I really hope that\u2019s true. As a Buckeye fan, I really do believe in Haskins and I\u2019d love to see him succeed for you guys.","9733":"Amari had what 200 more yards with 60000000x better QB play","9734":"You're talking one season. Let's relax.","9735":"Well what else do I have to go by? He\u2019s a rookie","9736":"Now sign Eric Reid so we can have a mostly Reid backfield","9737":"what crime did Bryce Hall commit","9738":"Wow, really nice player, def wasn't expecting him to go this high though.","9739":"Was my lab partner for Physics lab in college, really smart and down to earth guy. Glad to see him make it to the NFL!","9740":"Trying to remember, but might be one of the last players BoB recruited to Penn State lol","9741":"Looks just like his grandpa Andy","9742":"All the Reids in the secondary.","9743":"dude interned at blizzard what a nerd","9744":"Yeah Penn State!","9745":"I love that he interned at Blizzard more than anything","9746":"all i want is kenny robinson, please stop hurting me like this","9747":"Apparently this guy likes to spend some of his free time building computers. PC MASTER FUCKING RACE.","9748":">Penn State\n\nYup, that's a BOB pick right there","9749":"Hopefully Bryce Hall murdered someone so we can get him with our next pick","9750":"Oh shit hes from Mt. Laurel that's like the next town over from me","9751":"Doesn't look like a bad pick at the draft spot.","9752":"I would love it if Bryce Hall drops all the way to our sixth round pick. This is insane","9753":"I'd like to see Riley Reid backfield","9754":"Inb4 Andy Reid becomes a db because BoB promised to buy him fries","9755":"No I want him","9756":"You deserve what BoB did.","9757":"He probably failed some teams' physicals.","9758":"Didn\u2019t have a dead dad","9759":"Made of melted butter","9760":"He killed all the prospects relatives","9761":"I'm a PSU fan and he was always mocked in the 4th or 5th.  Seems to have fallen right about where he was expected.  Definitely a limited player but I hope he can make an impact for Houston.","9762":"Everybody look this guy\u2019s a freakin NERD!","9763":"He was a highly regarded PA prospect so I'm sure BOB was recruiting him early, but Reid committed to Franklin  5 or 6 months after BOB left the program.","9764":"Good upside, but injury history.\n\nI think it's a good pick","9765":"I like how you think.","9766":"Trade for Reily Reiff too","9767":"What","9768":"Yeah, every time they talked about him on TV during games they\u2019d say he was a \u201ccerebral player\u201d","9769":"Yep same class as Saquon who told a story about meeting with BoB his first visit to PSU before he committed","9770":"Our whole team has injury history. He will fit right in.","9771":"KICK HIS ASS!","9772":"I understood it as rad backfield and hated that pun and I gave the \"I hate this pun\" answer. Did I do something wrong?","9773":"But he\u2019s black that\u2019s the coded language for white players \ud83d\ude1f","9774":"?? They were referencing how he\u2019s a data sciences major","9775":"Right I\u2019m saying normally announcers talk about white players being cerebral and scrappy lol","9776":"What a waste of a pick. I know it\u2019s the 4th round but at least get a full man.","9777":"Naw, that's a full man.","9778":"Wasn\u2019t this guy supposed to go high last year?","9779":"First Cane off the board, remember when we were good?\n\nI member.","9780":"Slightly disappointing career in Miami, he's such a talent Imo. Jags got their Pozluzny replacement","9781":"he was good in Miami","9782":"I think I have this guy in my Franchise on madden. He's like an 83 right now.\n\nSo... **STEAL**","9783":"Hell yeah","9784":"the u finally got a player drafted","9785":"he's only a quarter as good as his brother shaquille fullman","9786":"He\u2019s going to be a good 2 down linebacker.","9787":"[JAGUARS: So Quarterman, how's about you and me?](https:\/\/youtu.be\/uV8TcpRQJCM?t=78)","9788":"REP THE U BABY","9789":"Eno Benjamin is just sitting there and we need a halfback","9790":"Let\u2019s go!","9791":"What type of fact is that","9792":"That name looks like one that a video game would generate for a new player.","9793":"Great name","9794":"SHAQQ","9795":"Was a fan of his at Miami.  Good pick.","9796":"Went to high school w bro, raised in Jax. Glad the Jags chose to bring him home.","9797":"how you gonna  be named quarterman and not be a quarterback man smh","9798":"That's a great pick for them. Jags actually filling up their defense nicely.","9799":"YES I had this guy mocked at r\/jaguars in the fourth. I am excite.","9800":"For the fools that just talk out the sides of their neck, you have no idea about quarterman this young man is a monster of a linebacker and Jacksonville got a good player, also coming from the U he has a good work ethic. I'm not a Jaguar fan just letting you know you guys got a very good young man and well worth a 4th round pick.","9801":"Love this pick he was so good here at Miami","9802":"Early prediction: he'll play exactly 5 snaps in the nickel position then never play again.","9803":"He has some absolutely awful tape, I'm shocked he went this high.","9804":"Denzel perryman part 2","9805":"A fullback is like 4 quarterbacks but it only takes up one roster spot. If you need a backup QB, just chop him up","9806":"Good value imo. If they waited til the 5th round to get him he would've been Shaquille Fifthman.","9807":"That is exceptionally clever.","9808":"Well he did take a year of because we didn\u2019t play college ball last year. Yep no football at all. 6-7 and get shut out in our bowl game? What are you talking about? Never happened.","9809":"Next year Rosseau is going in the 1st, and Brevin shortly after.","9810":"We'll be back one day","9811":"How dare you underestimate Schobert","9812":"How\u2019s his neck game compared to Poz","9813":"I would attribute a lot of it to coaching\/development","9814":"Started every single game for 4 years. He was THE leader. He is a little slow, and plays a little too much on instinct which gets him out of place, but he is such a hard worker and does everything you want out of a player.","9815":"Good vs the run. Gonna struggle greatly vs the pass.","9816":"He's a hard working grinder whose best skill (run defending) doesn't match his size for the NFL (6'0\" 230). \n\nHe's gonna be a good NFL backup who rotates in on running obvious downs.","9817":"He is originally from Jacksonville too and played high school ball here!","9818":"I got him to like an 89 superstar x-factor lmao","9819":"Hahahaha yeah like imagine losing to FIU a team blown out by FAU hahahahaha good thing there's no chance that would ever happen","9820":"FIU beat us.\n\nShit still hurts","9821":"How dare you underestimate future Jags HOFer Shaq Quarterman","9822":"Eh, I think it's more that he was just athletically limited. Player development certainly hasn't been perfect at Miami, but it's not like they could make him more athletic.","9823":"Absolutely loved him at the U","9824":"Sounds like he could, at the very least, convert to a core STer","9825":"He has some bad instincts, so bad I didn't think he'd go until the 6th round at the earliest.","9826":"And we drafted the guy who beat us, ugh","9827":"Well yeah, but he wasn't productive either. I think Miami isn't that great at refining technique. I say this as a Canes fan.","9828":"We all did. Hard not to with a mentality like his.","9829":"Might be too slow to make a big impact on ST. those types are usually safeties. I think he can be a very good starter if he knows he doesn't have to make huge plays.","9830":"I'm a huge canes fan and love Shaq, but I agree with you. The bad positioning plus being slow puts him out of the play a lot. Could be much better in the NFL where he doesn't feel like he HAS to make game changing plays. If he can control himself more he will be a good starter.","9831":"I'm a Canes fan too and I agree with you. There's a bunch of examples of guys we didn't develop well. I just don't think Shaq is the best example of it. He maybe could've gone a bit higher if he was developed better, but his ceiling was pretty limited overall. Guys like Garvin and Joe Jackson I think are the ones we should be more pissed about.","9832":"Kwiatkowski was one of our slower ILBs and a thumper who excelled on ST","9833":"I'm a Miami fan too, you would've just thought after starting 4 years he would've developed some better instincts. Hoping for the best for him.","9834":"Interesting. You don't see that very often. I really hope the best for Shaq cause he is everything you want in a player.","9835":"I really think a lot of it came from him feeling like he had to do something. I think Pinkney is the best from the group though.","9836":"Your outside guys (gunners) need to be the speedsters....  \nGuys more toward the middle and up-the-gut need to be your bigger instinctive guys like LBs.","9837":"Yeah I definitely would've picked Pinckney over him, but he doesn't have too great a tape either.","9838":"I know that but it's usually the safety type guys that are the playmakers on st.","9839":"We had such high hopes for that group lol Really thought they would be some of the best ever at the U.","9840":"Once again, we'd like to thank [sportsreference.com](https:\/\/www.sports-reference.com\/) for helping out with college stats for our draft cards.

Will be interesting to see how much his size hampers him in the NFL.","9845":"Louisiana Tech going back-to-back!","9846":"Exceptional value","9847":"HELL YES. I was 99.9% sure KC was going to steal him the pick before us. Incredible value here. Incredible draft Mayock, go take a nap now that we have no more draft picks.","9848":"Top 5 corner in draft","9849":"Wanted my Jets to get him. Good player! The two LA Tech DBs going back to back haha.","9850":"Can't believe he fell this far down. You got a hell of a CB, Raiders. Dude came in as a true freshman and has been a shutdown corner for Tech every year. Treat him well!","9851":"Buy, beg, borrow or.....?","9852":"Great pick! Future Hall of Famer. I've never heard of him but I'm certain of it.","9853":"Tell me how to feel!","9854":"Zoom in on his eyes lol","9855":"AMIK LETS GO, happy for him","9856":"The Louisiana Tech CB double!","9857":"Great slot option. I honestly wouldnt be surprised if he has a better career than Damon Arnette.","9858":"Nice","9859":"Good pick","9860":"Surprised this guy was drafted so late. Seems like a great pick up.","9861":"This guy is the definition of a Gruden grinder.","9862":"I wanted my Jaguars to pick him","9863":"I am sad. I so badly wanted this kid. GL \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24","9864":"Yaaassss!!!","9865":"ESPN let's just show Andy Reid fatass instead of showing highlights of the players being drafted. Anyways I love this pick","9866":"Shocked Amik went this low","9867":"Love the value.  He was a fun guy to watch.  I thought we might take him at 80.","9868":"Hey that's not a receiver","9869":"They are doxxing Lauren and Stephen and Deborah","9870":"Shane we didn't pick him.","9871":"5'8 tho","9872":"They LSU now","9873":"Damn I wanted him. He\u2019s a playmaker","9874":":)","9875":"I'll see you in Canton when he makes it to the hall. I have a good feeling about this dude.","9876":"Fantastic pick!","9877":"looks like EDP from last night's video","9878":"they did a 1 minute segment on him a couple minutes later","9879":"We can convert 'em","9880":"But he's TOUGH and a FIGHTER which seems to be a theme this year.","9881":"Go watch the tape. Doesn't matter to him.","9882":"If you\u2019re under 6\u2019 then swipe left","9883":"I can't wait to see funky shit with big WRs and TEs in the slot vs Oakland if he's the nickel CB\n\nDamn good player though, this is IMO the best value pick Mayock has made so far this draft","9884":"There\u2019s nobody from LSU left, we need Louisiana players","9885":"Really?! Could you tell me a little bit about him? I don't watch much college ball","9886":"Yeah I saw that","9887":"https:\/\/imgur.com\/gallery\/1vVuuJH\n\nI went to LaTech he\u2019s actually tough af","9888":"Seemed to be the theme last year too","9889":"I believe you're getting downvoted because Robertson [doesn't care how big they are he will man handle the receiver] (https:\/\/streamable.com\/plx0p).","9890":"Did you see the last play vs the Lions last year? Karl Joseph was on a tight end that had at least 7 inches on him and still got up and ended the game for us. \n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be a problem","9891":"Yes there is","9892":"He was an absolute shutdown corner in college. His stats went down last year because teams just avoided his side of the field. Y\u2019all got a steal and a good character guy","9893":"His height is probably the main reason he fell so far but he hasn't let that affect his play. At Tech, he seemed like he was always around the ball, always on the receiver, very good at deflecting passes and intercepting the ball. I could see the Raiders using him at the slot almost immediately","9894":"[If you want some film on him vs a top school (LSU) ](https:\/\/youtu.be\/ICUgjQdCSN4)","9895":"Mmmm, next year is gonna be fun.","9896":"I dig it. I'll take toughness and fight over \"potential\" any day.","9897":"I know he will. And I wanted to draft him personally, he holds his own vs big guys. There's still definitely limits to that vs NFL physicality and vertical abilities.","9898":"Welp, you've got me hyped!","9899":"foster moreau making giant holes for lsu in that game","9900":"True, but his tenacity and ball production will be incredible in the slot.","9901":"you love to see it","9902":"Holy shit Bleacher Report tipped the wrong pick","9903":"Cool. Just skip over the last 5 picks ESPN. I'm so glad we got to hear Luke Bryant instead.","9904":"LMAO BR misreported Bryce Hall and did a whole analysis on the pick","9905":"That is a Dr Seuss name","9906":"Key and Peele all star.","9907":"Bryce Hall in shambles","9908":"I'm assuming this is a CB convert. 6ft 190 and runs a 4.37. Seems like good outside CB size and speed.","9909":"He went before Amik?!?!","9910":"LA Tech putting them DBs in the league","9911":"Brett Kollman panicking about chiefs taking hall was hilarious","9912":"Bleacher had them taking Hall thats tough. Also tho wtf happened to Hall","9913":"https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HCsi7vY.jpg","9914":"Formerly L'Jarius Chuck","9915":"This dude looks like a banger. I wouldn't want to line up against him","9916":"Why not a CB? Safety is one of our strongest position groups","9917":"Why don't they let these fans read the names?!? NFL IT department can suck a fuck.","9918":"I feel the need","9919":"I was surprised that he went before Amik Robertson but he was literally the next pick lol","9920":"I assume we'll use him as a corner.","9921":"RIP Bleacher Report. That shit was hilarious","9922":"Dude wtf is happening this draft. Bleacher report had the wrong pick and ESPN still garbage","9923":"What a name","9924":"Where is all the dead family? Do they think I watch this for the football facts?","9925":"Andy Reid wore that Hawaiian for the first round, no?","9926":"Chiefs in the Airsign Arrowhead Chief","9927":"Do we know whether he's actually going into the NFL instead of following his grandfather's footsteps as a professional golfer?","9928":"Lol they just skipped the Jags","9929":"Thats not Bryce hall","9930":"serious question: why Chiefs Kingdom and not Chiefdom?","9931":"Yep, that was funny af","9932":"I was just so confused","9933":"At least he apologized.","9934":"My brother said they did something similar in the 1st round with the Dolphins and Swift.  Talked about him being the pick for 5 minutes and then the Dolphins traded out.","9935":"Who\u2019d they say?","9936":"Yeah, even did the video segment","9937":"Skip over a bunch and then announce the most random pick possible","9938":"Its seems that they are catering to non-NFL fans to watch the later rounds anyway they can by doing this. Wtf","9939":"I was thinking Hall the whole draft but this guy should be good, too.","9940":"I heard he has twitter beef with Jackmerius Tactheratrix","9941":"Guzentite","9942":"Well, his leg is, anyway.","9943":"Yup! They said that he played CB before safety so the team likely converted him out of need.","9944":"Just barely.","9945":"Major injury.","9946":"No athleticism.  Smart guy though","9947":"To summarize the two other guys who responded:\n1. Injury\n2. Not athletic","9948":"One of the best subtle jokes from the show","9949":"He\u2019s likely to switch to CB at the next level anyways","9950":"ESPN talked about how he had previously played CB. Hopefully that\u2019s how the Chiefs see him.","9951":"He's probably gonna play CB. They talked about it on the analysis","9952":"Maybe planning to move him to corner? Late round DBs are often drafted based on athleticism and versatility to play multiple positions. Just like how we moved Fuller around last year. He played as a slot corner as well as moved to safety when Juan went down. The theme with Veach's picks seems to be flexibility to play multiple positions.","9953":"He used to play CB.","9954":"He does both, i imagine he will be playing CB","9955":"They are going to convert him to CB. He plays more natural there.","9956":"ESPN just said he played corner up until last year and was a more natural fit there. They said most teams were projecting him as a press corner in the NFL.","9957":"The need for Sneed","9958":"Chiefdom sounds stupid","9959":"Why Dolphins when few word do trick?","9960":"They were so stoked about the pick too","9961":"Hall","9962":"Ahh nice...not watching any broadcast just assumed by his size and speed that's what we were looking for. Definitely need the depth and competition.","9963":"Feel like a bit of a replacement of the Fuller role. Slot corner who can jump in and play snaps at Safety in a disguised coverage or if there's injuries.","9964":"Chiefs fiefdom","9965":"Yep, they were so hyped","9966":"A++ to B- with this guy, They love Hall","9967":"Hey!

Should do well in the NFL","9976":"They really are investing in that secondary aren't they?","9977":"Dude is a baller.  You got a good one Jags.  Great man corner even though he is undersized.  Comes from a strong CB family as well.","9978":"MSU!!","9979":"Did Amik Robertson poison a baby?","9980":"Anyone else annoyed by every tweet saying the overall pick #, but then the subreddit is using 4.31 to format. Compensatory picks make it tough to no which pick is which","9981":"Where are they getting thee facts","9982":"Finally a spartan has been drafted! Loved seeing Josiah Scott play at MSU!","9983":"From the Sparties to Jacksonville. A climatic upgrade, at least.","9984":"Hall must be a dead man","9985":"This was the first year they didn't go to commercial break during the Bengals first round pick since 2003. And it's just because they couldn't.","9986":"It\u2019s a Christmas miracle","9987":"Kinda worried about next year though, could be dicey.","9988":"Hell yeah brother","9989":"If he did, ESPN would love it","9990":"he killed his own ankle","9991":"Cat bro tell me how to feel about this","9992":"They need to stop the draft right now and start up again in a week","9993":"Oh fuck yeah","9994":"Shhhh we need a slot corner, don't remind anyone he's alive.","9995":"From a little thing called drugs","9996":"Two in a row, perhaps?\n\nEdit: we're back","9997":"I think Naquan Jones and Antjuan Simmons are the most likely options if they have good seasons. Especially Naquan at his size.","9998":"Only if it was his own family though","9999":"Great athlete and has good ball-skills, snagged a fair amount of picks during his time here.  Pretty undersized so I\u2019d have to imagine he slides in and plays nickel for you guys","10000":"One round per day. 15 minutes per pick. Week long draft","10001":"Ha I\u2019m realizing I don\u2019t know as much as I think I do about the draft bc I woulda been completely ok if we took Robertson at pick 53 lol","10002":"I bet it's his height, same for Scott, both are good productive CBs that are just short. Also it seems this draft has people going all over the place so I'm not sure where anyone would truly go, not that I know where anyone would truly go anyways. Maybe the 5th is where Robertson finds a home?\n\nEDIT: NOPE!!! Guess LV needed Robertson more than us...","10003":"Raiders just snagged him \ud83d\ude29","10004":"Good news, we seem to have the same mindset as Mike Mayock.","10005":"Bleacher Report slaying this guy on YouTube \" He's never blocked anyone in his life.

I don't get this at all.","10030":"He\u2019s actually a capable blocker.

Good blocker and starter for a great time so he'll find a home. Just not what teams want before the 5th usually.\n\nBrycen here is like the opposite. Awful blocker but decent receiver. So he and Moss really aren't filling the same role on people's draft boards.","10037":"Also his legs are jelly","10038":"Is he still on the board? I wasn\u2019t able to watch yesterday\u2019s draft","10039":"People really though 2 catches and last name was enough for him to go before the 5th or 6th","10040":"It's like an o line men but not really.","10041":"Skill players are more exciting.  And I'm guessing Rams are comfortable with their O-line.  Injuries and shuffling around so much (with a broken down RB) last year was the cause of our problems.","10042":"He's damn good","10043":"Trade?","10044":"Boiler Up!","10045":"He\u2019s a fantastic route runner and has great hands. He could be a lot more than a 3rd stringer.","10046":"Also a good route runner. Good fit in LA but not sure how he fits with Everett and Higbee.","10047":"I\u2019m just some guy but I was never *that* impressed with him at LSU. The Moss name carries a lot of weight and Thaddeus has some intriguing features but he seemed a far cry from being NFL ready.","10048":"Average blocker and an average athlete. Below average reciever. People only thought he'd go high because of his name.","10049":"I get that, I never said he was good but none of these tight ends were projected high and a lot are still going.","10050":"> He is considerably slower than his dad\n\nI mean, not really a fair comparison lol","10051":"yes","10052":"Its like the opposite of an olineman, he doesnt block at all","10053":"But we already have 2 good tight ends under contract. Figured they\u2019d draft the linemen or a corner but what do I know.","10054":"Don't know. He's in the last year of  his deal though. We already extended Tyler Higbee, and we will need to extend Cooper Kupp and John Johnson in the same year too. So he's most likely gone either through FA or trade.","10055":"He made some big plays for LSU late in the year that really raised his stock. I want him on the Vikings specifically cause of the name and I\u2019m an LSU fan. But that\u2019s why I\u2019m not a GM","10056":"He had that one sweet catch","10057":"All of these tight ends were projected just about as high as they are going besides Deguara","10058":"\"What do I know\", the draft for every team every year in a nutshell","10059":"Everett is a free agent next year","10060":"LINEMAN","10061":"Interesting.  First guy this year that wasn't invited to the combine.","10062":"ESPN is literally 7 picks behind on player discussions.","10063":"All American in the fourth round at a position of need, I'll take it.","10064":"Take a hike Fromm \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24","10065":"He's not a bad pick. Cool fact: he actually demonstrated how using your left hand to brush your teeth works better.\n\nMaybe some of that skill will translate to the pros.","10066":"DOTSON! WE GOT DOTSON HERE!","10067":"OH LORD HE  \n\nL O R G E","10068":"THICC BOI","10069":"Any relation to Demar Dotson?","10070":"Meanwhile ESPN still talking about a dude picked 7 spots back","10071":"Got us a bouncer for when we have to play Myles Garrett.","10072":"Picks are flying in boys","10073":"I saw the capital K and thought kicker","10074":"Better than all gb picks combined lmao. And I'm a gb fan","10075":"He was on a billboard in Lafayette . I drove by it every day. He\u2019s a big boi","10076":"Finally interior OL  help!","10077":"Thank god, if just to stop the people complaining about the olineman. Pretty clear that Biadasz injury concerns have not been alleviated and that he's gonna fall until the price is about nothing.","10078":"FINALLY","10079":"Good pick to fill a need. Love it.","10080":"We caught up!","10081":"FUCK","10082":"I DON'T KNOW WHO HE IS OR IF HE'S EVEN GOOD\n\nBUT IT SAYS \"G\" NEXT TO HIM, I'M HAPPY","10083":"THICC CAJUN FOOD BOI LINEMAN","10084":"Woooooo wonder why not biadaiz but glad we went IOL","10085":"Fucking finally","10086":"yes that is the position he plays","10087":"Has one of the best PFF run-blocking grade of any IOL in the draft.","10088":"Diamond in the rough","10089":"Had to get in the Luke Bryan filler. You know, give the NFL fans what they came to see.","10090":"That's Jake \"Tom Brady\" Fromm to you","10091":"Is Fromm really that bad?","10092":"I know very little about this player.\n\nBUT THIS IS GOOD","10093":"THIS PLEASES THE NUT","10094":"He was an All-American. He's good.","10095":"Broke: Corn-fed Iowan linemen\n\nWoke: Rice-fed Cajun linemen","10096":"finally, some good fucking filled needs","10097":"Oh I really like that.","10098":"Really made me feel better","10099":"Wtf was that even? Kinda felt forced like the offset video.","10100":"Jakey Noodle Arm","10101":"I\u2019m liking our draft so far","10102":"Same. The 2nd round receiver is the one I feel the least confident about, but the Steelers rarely strike out at that position. The other picks seem like fantastic pieces.","10103":"I wasn\u2019t sure about the WR at first but he seems like a great guy, physically he\u2019s a beast, and some of his highlights are really nice. And it\u2019s a second round pick in one of the deepest WR classes in a while so it\u2019s likely he\u2019s a first round guy in most years","10104":"Watched some scouting vids of him \u2013\u00a0got me going. He may be a huge red zone weapon.","10105":"Why is ESPN allowed to host the draft? They are like 10 picks behind and their analysts are idiots.","10106":"Poor guy had to sit through Luke Bryan straining to see his name on TV","10107":"*Pour a little sugar in her Dixie Cup*\n\nIt's always on Falcons picks, I swear to god.","10108":"Imagine getting drafted and the coverage has 'PLAY IT AGAIN, PLAY IT AGAIN' while it's happening","10109":"He\u2019s awesome. Really liked watching him at Cal","10110":"Full disclosure: I\u2019m absurdly biased as a Cal fan, but it\u2019s always surprised me to see Davis get more hype than Hawkins. I know that Davis probably has more raw talent, but Hawkins is incredible in his own right.\n\nFalcons props to your scouts because y\u2019all seriously got a good one right here.","10111":"Eagles is shambles","10112":"Go bears!","10113":"HOW MANY FUCKING WAYS ARE THERE TO SPELL JALEN","10114":"Absolute fools. The lions will steal Mann out from under their noses","10115":"Jaylinn is a bad name. Spelled this way it is atrocious. No chance of success.","10116":"Hawkeye","10117":"wooo go bears\n\ngood pickup Falcons i swear im not biased at all","10118":"This guy is not worth a 4th round pick, huge reach","10119":"I followed someone's advice and switched to B\/R it's much better which is pretty sad","10120":"they should just broadcast a police scanner since they love that type of emotion","10121":"> They are like 10 picks behind\n\nThis is how it is every year.","10122":"They have the largest production crew, which I think is why they are running it. This is terrible.","10123":"Everytime man, first Migos i think, then the nurse, now this.","10124":"I was hoping we\u2019d land him late. I had him in my personal mock a while back for the Jags. Good pick.","10125":"I'm with you on Hawkins. You heard his name more often in terms of making a play but both him and Davis did a hell of a job limiting explosive plays","10126":"lol how can a 4th round pick be a reach","10127":"bruv, your second round pick would\u2019ve been available.. fuck it nvm","10128":"We have no pick til 7th. I wouldve preferred Hall or someone but they wanted a guy they may not have gotten.","10129":"Idk man your team just took a kicker in the 5th.","10130":"6th round at best. Probably closer to a ufda.","10131":"Yeah. Ticker\u2019s worse but at least I can see the picks and don\u2019t have to watch as many brands pimping out Covid","10132":"It was offset. Fuck the migos and their constant shitty takes on who should replace Matt Ryan lmao","10133":"Because mock drafts are NEVER wrong lol\n\nPeople put too much stock into all this crap.","10134":"No point in arguing with a Pat's fan, man. Let's just enjoy watching them be mediocre this year.","10135":"Duggar had a 2nd round grade...","10136":"That makes a lot more sense for why he was drafted in the 4th. Will be a good get for y'all","10137":"And thats pretty dumb too","10138":"Once again, we want to thank [sportsreference.com](https:\/\/www.sports-reference.com\/), who have provided most of the stats you see today and this weekend.

You probably thought we were set at qb when we drafted Russell Wilson.","10184":"It's the Luke Bryan era now","10185":"Hopefully to launch a tv career.

Not again!","10188":"He's even got long hair. He's as good as done :(","10189":"I'd imagine Luke gets cut and brought back later into the season.","10190":"Eh maybe not. We have 4 TEs and 2 are injury prone, so if we are worried about having to start a practice squad guy again we may keep him. 5 TE is a lot to have, but 3 TE is not if they both get hurt.","10191":"He went to Stanford, he only listens to Alternative Country artists","10192":"Has every starting TE from Stanford since the Harbaugh era been drafted?

I read somewhere that we\u2019re ranked #1 in athleticism for the 2020 draft","10214":"This is definitely a pick looking past this current season.

Whole big thing.","10231":"This is so much better than all the BS on ESPN","10232":"Oh, definitely. It\u2019s pretty rare for a rookie TE to make much of an impact. Although Dissly looked poised to breakout his rookie year. He\u2019s huge at 6\u20197\u201d and his draft profile describes him as a field stretcher so hopefully he becomes a big target for Wilson. I just wonder how many TEs we\u2019ll keep on the active roster this year.","10233":"Knowing pete, hes probably a decent blocker.

The game he had against OU he made so many big plays.","10387":"Watching him declare as a Baylor fan knowing he could\u2019ve completely annihilated our sack record for another year broke my heart, but he\u2019s such a steal for y\u2019all.

Adverts. Shitty pop song. Adverts.\n\nHow many picks have we just missed? Didn't hear anything about the two Vikings picks.\n\nAmerican TV can be so fucking frustrating.","10428":"This is huge for Charlotte.  Started the program in 2013, moved to Conference USA in 2015.  Now 4 players drafted in the last 4 drafts, all in round 3 or 4.","10429":"Always happy to see people from UNC-Charlotte get drafted!","10430":"Sigh this pop singer is so annoying.","10431":"5 minute country song straight into a commercial, well done ESPN","10432":"During the draft, did ESPN think any of us gave a fuck about country music of the actual picks while following it up with commercials?","10433":"Reddit is as behind if not more than The ESPN announcers now","10434":"Let\u2019s go Cam!

It\u2019s like an optical illusion","10460":"It\u2019s the only guy wingo knows about","10461":"They do this every year with any QB that goes lower than they expected. Because past the 2nd or 3rd round the only players most people will know are the QBs","10462":"He any good?","10463":"Jake from Statefromm?","10464":"Reach. High upside guy, but not a fan of the pick.","10465":"What the Jets need, so I am happy.","10466":"He definitely projects to move inside. Has the intangibles and the work ethic. If he puts it together he could be a serviceable starter.","10467":"That's it until the 5th, then 2 more in the 6th","10468":"this made me lol...trade down gawd joe douglas","10469":"YOU DID IT!

Quick off the line too","10493":"Stud. John Brown, Diggs, Beasley, and him. Goddamn","10494":"Honestly a big steal. UCF student here and let me tell you this kid can ball. Surprised he fell this far. Expected packers to take him in round 2-3.","10495":"Best wide receiver in the draft","10496":"Really good pick by the Bills.  Josh Allen should be estatic","10497":"Finally, this guy is electric. 3rd round talent fell this far with great deep-ball tracking. Could be a steal","10498":"They didn't even show any highlights for Davis.  WTF","10499":"underrated player, great pick","10500":"UCF fan here, this man is an absolute steal","10501":"Atta boy Gabe! Congrats Bills, you just got a hell of a complement to Diggs.","10502":"I've watched him play in person multiple times and the Bills just got a total steal here. If he played for alabama he would've been taken in the first.","10503":"Yeah buddy! Go Knights!","10504":"When watching him at UCF, he always reminded me of a Mike Evans type of receiver. Would just take over games.","10505":"Bill's receiving court looks kind of good now","10506":"Didn't Buffalo have one of the smallest receiving cores in the league?\n\nTrading for Diggs and drafting this dude is for the best.","10507":"How many games do the bills win this year","10508":"Tell me how to feel!","10509":"Apparently he was training with Zack Moss (our 3rd rounder) predraft. #Bromance?","10510":"*Brian","10511":"FUCK","10512":"of course ESPN is still talking about the Jets, thanks for completely skipping our pick douchebags","10513":"Nice","10514":"72 Receptions?

Even ESPN stopped doing that","10517":"Steal","10518":"They never gonna talk about this man wtf....","10519":"Yay we took a developmental WR!","10520":"Diggs in shambles?","10521":"Over Gandy?","10522":"Finally!!! Lets fkin gooo","10523":"Weapon for Allen. Scary.","10524":"Saw this dude at Walmart at 1 am like 3 months ago near UCF and he's massive. Total stud I wish we got him","10525":"Dude balled against big competition and got burried with all the WR influx this year. Great pick.","10526":"Diggs is beside himself","10527":"I'm not as high on him as some others seem to be. That said, UCF has put out plenty of NFL quality receivers over the past 10 years or so.","10528":"Diggs in shambles and demands a trade","10529":"I get UCF used to be a meme, but they really have produced solid contributors. Also some really fun college seasons too.","10530":"He fast","10531":"UCF fan here. Total beast and a absolute steal.","10532":"The tragedy of his life: he once played solitaire with a deck of 51 cards.","10533":"Ucf and bills fan here. I'm stoked AF.","10534":"Most of the state of Florida will say great things about the guy, except for USF perhaps","10535":"As a UCF fan you guys are getting a great player. Especially for the pick. \n\nDude took over games for UCF he remindes me of OBJ","10536":"I love this guy, he was great for UCF and I'm sad that he's leaving but glad that he's on the bills","10537":"Awesome pick, sad we have to play against him 2x a year","10538":"hes a stud","10539":"He\u2019s tall, that\u2019s all you need to know","10540":"Dude is fantastic. I watch UCF and FSU.","10541":"He got the ball deep and took the top off the defense. Good for the QB you have I'd say","10542":"Another receiver Allen can bomb the ball to on go routes","10543":"Fast as shit too.","10544":"UCF alum.  Dude is a beast.  He has good size and very good body control.  He roasts corners in jump ball situations and has really good hands.  I think one of the knocks on him was his top speed, but I'm not sure it will be THAT big of an issue.  He is one of those players you watch and can't help but notice because it feels like they deliver on every possible opportunity.","10545":"Biggest steal since the Eagles snagged Wallace","10546":"Walterfootball had him as WR12 ahead of Pittman.","10547":"Too busy talking about the 3rd string QB the jets just drafted.","10548":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/CatzLUnz0Os","10549":"Guyinyellowjacketbehindtree.jpg","10550":"19, Obviously.","10551":"All the games!

You're going to love him. Gets good separation on deep routes, has great hands, and is very underrated as a blocker. We used him almost exclusively outside so he's going to need development on intermediate and short routes. High character guy who loves the game.","10556":"GOOD YOU EVIL BISON BASTARDS!","10557":"Dude chill, they're 3 picks behind","10558":"12","10559":"I don't understand why they refuse to use UCF.\n\nHopefully Gabe can adapt to the cold. Happy for him!","10560":"he just tweeted something weird and requested a trade","10561":"Nah, thats cole Beasleys replacement, not his","10562":"That UCF USF shootout from like 3 years ago is one of the best games I\u2019ve ever seen","10563":"Cmon trequan :(","10564":"Not sure how the 2017 national champions could be a meme","10565":"Gabriel \"Don't call me OBJ\" OBJ Davis","10566":"Perriman \ud83d\ude20\ud83e\udd2c","10567":"\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffe","10568":"YEP, saw him play as a student, guy is a beast.

Unless there's a big story like Michael Sam or Shaquem Griffin they kind of do the analysis either on delay or in bulk.","10574":"Probably Duke Williams' replacement.","10575":"Take it how you want it I am back","10576":"I\u2019m a UCF alumni and flew back for that game. Was front row, night game and in the student section with one of my best friends. Absolutely insane atmosphere...when Mike Hughes returned that kickoff with < 2 mins to go for a game winning touchdown I lost my shit as did everyone else. The first time and only time I literally blacked out for a minute because of pure fucking elation. Probably will never attend a better game than that, Go Knights.","10577":"The Memphis game a week later was arguably better","10578":"throw to him more","10579":"That 40 time really rose his stock, he was legit the 3rd or 4th wr on that ucf team","10580":"Why would we take a WR?","10581":"I assume you would've been happy with any receiver.","10582":"So many plays were just chuck it the fuck up to #13 \n\n\nAnd it worked","10583":"From a storyline perspective, nah. UCF and USF are huge rivals, and USF was supposed to be the best team in the American that year. They started the season ranked while UCF was a nobody. Coming into the game, bragging rights and division champs was on the line. Probably the only game we've played where both teams were top contenders.\n\nAnthony Miller was an absolute nightmare in that UCF Memphis game though.","10584":"That ray baker is the hardest hitter on the team, man","10585":"Right? There's gotta be another QB or two available","10586":"Especially with Fromm still on the board.","10587":"Pretty sure I shaved a few years off of my life watching that game","10588":"Maybe we can draft a fucking backup kicker next","10589":"Once again, we'd like to thank [sportsreference.com](https:\/\/www.sports-reference.com\/) for helping out with college stats for our draft cards.

We were never getting CeeDee, I truly believe we thought Raegor was the better prospect for better or worse","10691":"People in our sub are saying Sudfeld was a better prospect than Hurts. Yeah I feel comfortable throwing the word moron around. Well Hurts is objectively a good QB and a great backup to have for cheap but your opinion is fun.","10692":"Like the Reagor pick too but if it's true we didn't trade up using the Hurts pick to get Lamb then it's hard for me to get too excited about it as of now.","10693":"He\u2019s good but I would\u2019ve gone with Jefferson though that pick was fine","10694":"Taylor was in my top five 4-3 OLBs. Perfect for our defensive scheme.","10695":"I don't see anyone here talking about him as a coverage safety so I don't know what you're talking about.","10696":"He\u2019s a Jenkins replacement. And he will do it well.","10697":"You\u2019re just mad that the Eagles now have 2 QBs who are better than Dak","10698":"Lmfao you got me!","10699":"He\u2019s not like a true free safety but can cover in man and zone otherwise","10700":"They are well in front of the broadcasts","10701":"Des Nutz linebacker","10702":"I miss the LeSean DeSean combo lol","10703":"Can't wait to see the Player formerly known as Mousecop","10704":"We drafted Davoin Shower-Handel in the 3rd","10705":"In after Dawkins went to Clemson","10706":"As a Clemson fan I HATED Tanner Muse.

Comparing any drafts to what the Ravens do just isn't fair.","10712":"I'd rather them not so dak has more leverage","10713":"Logic garners far fewer upvotes than stupid meme comments","10714":"Two comp picks back to back before the fifth round starts.","10715":"Objectively a good QB based on what, being carried by loaded teams until falling flat in his biggest games? Like when he got benched in the BCS champioship game? I\u2019m curious how many times you have said \u201cIn Chip I trust,\u201d probably in the hundreds. Watching you wave your idiot Pom-Poms is fun as well","10716":"But that's also hindsight. I'd rather have reagor and a 2nd Rd lb saftey or cb than lamb. Obviously we took hurts which changes things but I still agree not trading up was smart at the time","10717":"I haven\u2019t heard any reports that say any team was willing to allow us to trade up to get him.","10718":"The eagles needed speed, Reagor was a much better fit.","10719":"Either wouldve been excellent picks but I prefer Reagor tbh. Feel like he was being slightly overlooked and fills a much bigger need for us","10720":"Jefferson is primarily a slot receiver which is a roll we have covered several times over. Our offense has been missing a long-term explosive deep threat since 2013 and that absence has been hampering our offense for a looooooong time. Jefferson would have been a very dumb pick for the eagles.","10721":"The thung is we are good with slot receivers.  That is what Jefferson for the most part strictly is.  Reagor plays both slot and outside and kick returns","10722":"Reagor is much better for our offense. We needed a speed receiver and he's that, plus he has an obscene vertical jump for contested catches too. He's like DJax 2.0, and gets to even learn from DJax for a year or two.","10723":"My thought is they think JJAW fits the role Jefferson would\u2019ve played.","10724":"And has a lot of room to grow.  He can be a starter for years.","10725":"The first reply with Eagles flair I see says \n\n>I\u2019m so fucking happy. Finally a safety, and one that can cover","10726":"Cue the stats rats in 3...2...","10727":"Y'all said the same thing about Daniel Jones in the eagles subreddit. Fuck you dumbasses. Take your hurt and subpar qbs and like it.","10728":"Hurts and Wentz better than Dak, lmao!","10729":"There are some jokes that are just so stupid that it's not even a funny joke. \n\nThis is one of those things. Hurts is not good lol","10730":"Yeah, seems like he can play in the box like Malcolm too","10731":"Maybe give EEEEE EEEEEEEE, a chance","10732":"You're on Tigernet, right? Your handle looks familiar.","10733":"(It was a joke, unless Dawkins decides to let someone wear it)","10734":"Yep, was a joke, unless Dawk decides he wants to let someone wear it.","10735":"Wow I didn\u2019t even realize that. I thought we had 1","10736":"Back to back picks I always find really fun","10737":"I was very against Chip the moment he traded Foles for Bradford and never got back on his wagon. I was at the Tampa Bay massacre live and the only joy I took from that game was that Chip\u2019s reign was absolutely not lasting another year after that mess. You can have the opinion Hurts sucks lol; that\u2019s fine, just know that most of the football world is not in agreement.","10738":"What in the world are you talking about? Jefferson would've played in the slot for us, which is currently occupied by Gred Ward Jr. JJAW plays on the outside and is likely to be replaced by Reagor. Don't just throw shit out there if you don't understand the receiver positions.","10739":"Except Jefferson is actually good and Arcega isn't","10740":"Aight you found one. You said \"a lot.\" I haven't seen \"a lot\"","10741":"Stats that were Coors field like?\n\nDak against bad teams, subscribe. \n\nDak against teams playing defense, unsubscribed.","10742":"Damn. Since he\u2019s obviously better than Dak, you just keep insulting Dak.","10743":"Haha yeah but I cant remember the last time ive visited there","10744":"95% of the fan base hates this pick, being in the vocal minority doesn\u2019t make you right.\n\nHurts was a decent college player, so was Tebow. Hurts will flame out","10745":"> which is currently occupied by Gred Ward Jr.\n\n*Ertz and Goedert\n\nThose two will be our primary slot receivers with Desean and Reagor also taking snaps there","10746":"JJAW was supposed to be a guy that can go up and get the ball and be a middle of the field, RZ target. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve heard about Jefferson. I\u2019m not talking about positions, I\u2019m talking about skill set. \n\nThey wanted a burner to stretch the field. That\u2019s why they went Reagor.","10747":"God damn you're obnoxious.","10748":"From what I understand Jefferson played primarily in the slot last year, but has been successful in the past on the outside as well. So there really is no telling where he would have played if he\u2019d have been picked. You have a point though they slot is occupied by Ward and we have someone to fill the WR1 position so what we needed was speed which reagor has more than Jefferson.","10749":"Ignore him, he doesn't know what he's talking about.","10750":"I\u2019m aware.","10751":"You're hilarious. So original.","10752":"Okay, being in the vocal majority doesn\u2019t make you right. You\u2019re delusional if you think that the majority is not vocal lmao. I really don\u2019t think that\u2019s true, but you keep being so sure!","10753":"Our front office and all our best beat reporters have all specifically said that they, and basically every other NFL team including the one that took him, were only looking at Jefferson as a slot option because that's what his skill set is. Jefferson isn't elite in any of the ways that JJAW was coming out of college, specifically as a possession and 50\/50 box-out Z receiver. \n\nI don't think you watched very much film on Jefferson. They never would've competed for the same spot.","10754":"Sorry to hear that, hope we can agree on the rest of the draft","10755":"No Jefferson played poorly on the outside. He broke out last year in the slot. Now was that because burrow didn't play well til last year? No clue but Jefferson is meant for the slot.","10756":"There is telling, our front office and best beat reporters have all said they viewed him exclusively as a slot option, just like most of the rest of the league. Jefferson is athletic enough to succeed at most WR spots in college but his outside receiver skill set is nowhere near elite enough to play anywhere but in the NFL right now.","10757":"Hurts sucks, you\u2019ll be parroting that before long","10758":"I\u2019m trying to justify the pick in my own mind, dude. No need to attack me.","10759":"https:\/\/www.sports-reference.com\/cfb\/players\/justin-jefferson-1.html\n\nSo nearly 900 yards, 6 touchdowns is playing poorly? Over 16 yard average? He certainly had a much better year in 2019 but I\u2019d say he\u2019s capable of playing the outside if needed.","10760":"https:\/\/kstp.com\/minnesota-sports\/justin-jefferson-nfl-draft-1st-round-pick-minnesota-vikings-lsu\/5709382\/\n\nThis article seems to indicate he\u2019s a dual threat since Adam Thielan is also primarily a slot receiver who can play outside when needed.","10761":"I'm not trying to attack you, but we're already getting massively shit on for the Reagor pick because people don't understand scheme and spreading misinformation isn't going to help anything.","10762":"When he played out side he wasn\u2019t nearly as productive and moving to slot turned him into a first round pick.","10763":"He played both inside and out at LSU, he will be inside for the Vikings. Adam Thielen is one of the best route-runners and recivers in the NFL so he can genuinely play wherever they need him. Jefferson doesn't currently have any of Thielen's elite qualities. \n\nI watched every game of Jefferson the last couple years, please just trust me on this.","10764":"Now ESPN takes away the fucking ticker when they go to break wtf","10765":"What the Heck","10766":"Don't fucking curse!","10767":"Trade details pls\n\nEdit: a 4th and 2 7ths in return.

Our sub is in shambles.","10935":"Let\u2019s send him to Minnesota, next best thing","10936":"BB is just waiting until as late as possible to draft him and then turn him into Brady 2.0.","10937":"There were people who legit thought he'd be a late 1st - mid 2nd round pick","10938":"Send him back to Georgia with a golden fiddle","10939":"Fuck it, if he can block Gute will probably take him","10940":"Pats in the 6th","10941":"ESPN is losing their minds right now","10942":"BuT HeS a WiNnEr","10943":"He is this years Kaaya","10944":"Fromm sounds like a great coach but a sure fire career backup","10945":"He\u2019s nothing crazy physically and form wise, I put him behind Eason more based off of all the big brain comments with the mid round physical traits","10946":"Don't hate him they just recognize an obviously bad QB.","10947":"Can you get mono twice if you make out with enough 19 year olds from Hoboken","10948":"It's called mono not duo he's safe","10949":"If they needed insurance they should've gotten Jake Fromm State Farm","10950":"He got cut right? Hopefully","10951":"Don't fucking mention his name ever.","10952":"I\u2019m not going to stand here and listen to all of this Luke Falk slander. He played fine in his first game when he came in after Siemian went down and he was better against the Patriots than Darnold and better than Darnold in college too. Not to mention the Jets coaching staff are a laughing stock and that supporting cast around him on offense was terrible.","10953":"Amen. Was hoping he would go to Dolphins or somewhere in the NFC, but I'm very happy for him","10954":"And it was glorious","10955":"God damnit","10956":"Dammit I was hoping no one would bring that game up","10957":"Justin Fields about to get drafted before Fromm at this rate","10958":"2020 draft has run this phrase into the ground and stomped on it until it\u2019s heart stopped beating.","10959":"For real, why is he dropping so far?","10960":"Howie Roseman in shambles they got his guy :\/","10961":"Seriously. I wouldn't want Fromm on the jets anyways, but there is no way in hell this guy is better than Fromm","10962":"I think we used a pick we got from them also, so I had a similar thought","10963":"I just feel bad for him now.","10964":"I haven't watched him play but he apparently had a 60% completion percentage.   Does he just not have an accurate arm or were his receivers dropping a lot of passes?","10965":"Laughs in Jalen","10966":"When you have 3 picks in the round, why not? You're more likely to get a serviceable QB in the 4th than the 6th.","10967":"I saw this in another thread but I think it's becoming a trend to invest in a decent back up QB on a rookie contract","10968":"I was mildly surprised at the pick but he wasn\u2019t going to last to the 5th, and you don\u2019t find developmental guys in the 6th...those are camp bodies.

Our QB2 was David Fales.\n\nWe were definitely looking for a backup QB in this draft.","10977":"We have David Fales as our only other QB rn.

So i guess theres that. but i honestly dont know much about him myself.","10987":"He is probably less talented than Fromm, but serves the backup role better","10988":"This made me laugh then cry.","10989":"Are we just going to comment this any time a QB is drafted?","10990":"Fake news","10991":"He wouldn\u2019t have it any other way","10992":"PAWS UP","10993":"I HAVE A PLAN, I JUST NEED MORE TIME","10994":"Might also be that, for the most part, 'they' don't either.","10995":"we realized after the Luke Falk games that having a decent backup is preferred","10996":"QB2 was a need.","10997":"Never felt that way about the Jets before except during those weeks.  And we have seen some shit.  I mean I've felt terrible before but that was a fucking nightmare it really was, and then you throw in the Patriots Bengals and Dolphins games that followed.  Brutal","10998":"Jets getting sick and going into quarantine before it was fashionable","10999":"It was uglier than Peterman. At least Bills fans could find some amusement in their misery","11000":"Depending on how recent, I think the cardinals mess of Skelton, hall, and lindley (they're basically all one person) might be his competition","11001":"The only reason why he was \u201cbetter\u201d than Peterman is because Peterman chucked the ball up at random when he panicked, while Falk just went into the fetal position.","11002":"Love this meme\/pasta","11003":"If people are pissed that we used a mid 4th round pick for a cheap backup QB they gotta get their head checked.","11004":"We all know he's a Bear","11005":"Not often I agree with a Vikings fan","11006":"Don\u2019t you realize? They\u2019re taking Tom Flacco in the sixth. Bill knows he\u2019s elite","11007":"If you watched any of Georgia's game last year you'd know that their passing game was not good. It didn't help that a couple of their receivers got hurt but Fromm just straight up wasn't a good passer.","11008":"Nah we don\u2019t want him anymore","11009":"Easy to win when you\u2019re handing off to Nick Chubb, Sony Michel, and Deandre Swift haha still should have won the natty in 2017.","11010":"Being a career backup is harder than people think.","11011":"His name sounds like Josh Framm, who was the lead character (other than the dog) in the Air Bud movies.","11012":"Kellen Mond-esque?","11013":"It's a good thing the Jets are drafting a backup QB then.\n\nJames Morgan might not even be that good.

So inspirational","11022":"is this your first draft here","11023":"He's an offensive coordinator that just hasn't had his mediocre playing career yet.","11024":"He's just not that good","11025":"I just dont get it\n\n62% completion 24 TDs 7 picks\n\n68% completion, 30 TDs 6 picks\n\n61% completion 24 TDs 5 picks\n\n8000ish career yards\n\nagainst SEC defenses\n\nI don't get how he's seen as THIS bad\n\na guy that went 20TDs 17 picks last year went in the first round","11026":"No one went to his birthday party.","11027":"Hands small","11028":"Not enough physical talent.\n\nI think Fromm is similar to Luke Falk in terms of tools.","11029":"He's just not very good at playing football.","11030":"Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m sure the Redskins or Cowboys will pick him.","11031":"This last season they had some WR problems with injuries","11032":"*cries in JLo*","11033":"why the \/s?  Falk shouldn't be on an active roster","11034":"It works in Madden","11035":"Worked for Allen","11036":"Why is that door open?","11037":"The Kaep way, maybe he'll make it to the SB","11038":"Morgan will master bending his knee as an example to all opposing quarterbacks.","11039":"Poor Luke Falk.","11040":"You expect originality from reddit?","11041":"Sam Darnold wouldn\u2019t have it any other way","11042":"Yes","11043":"Probably!","11044":"ORTHUR!!!!!!!!!!","11045":"Shit was literally surreal. Felt like I was watching a real life rebuild of a 60 OVR Madden team.","11046":"As a jets fan I have watched a lot of bad QB play in my life. Luke falk is by far the worst and it\u2019s not all that close.","11047":"r\/Petermaniacs","11048":"Good point!","11049":"That may have been the worst QB room I ever will have witnessed. Truly god awful.","11050":"Hope so","11051":"I think teams are worried he didn\u2019t play better on a Georgia team that was absurdly stacked with talent. Even if the play calling and receivers were suspect last year.","11052":"Career backup QB is one of the best jobs in sports.","11053":"He's more likely a career 3rd string","11054":"this man literally did the best concrete statue cosplay i\u2019ve ever seen in that eagles game. my dead dog shows more mobility. i have ptsd from that game yes why do you ask.","11055":"I\u2019m a Nole so it was about the only thing I enjoyed last season","11056":"Nah we don\u2019t want him. See ya later Fromm","11057":"IN SHAMBLES IN SHAMBLES","11058":"The ground is in shambles!","11059":"No I was here when the Bears traded up one spot for Trubs","11060":"The next Chase Daniel","11061":"Fair, but are any of the guys getting drafted ahead of him any better?","11062":"It's really this simple.","11063":"Fromm is basically just AJ McCarron. \n\nHis college stats were 77 TDs, 15 INTs,  67% with over 9000 yards, also against SEC defenses and he wasnt picked until the 5th round. He was also a two time champion starter and finished 2nd in the Heisman race once","11064":"Go watch film rather than look at stats\n\nHe's not awful but his arm makes him extremely limited in the NFL, and he hasn't really grown much since his freshman year. He's a great guy to have in a QB room but if you put him out there you'll have to neuter your playbook, even if he could tell you every single downfield play option that he can't hit reliably. \n\nEason and Morgan are unlikely to develop into starters but their arm at least gives you a shot in the dark at being able to stun a defense with a couple big plays.","11065":"Surprised his stats are that nice. Whenever I\u2019ve seen him play it seems like I am watching a Wisconsin QB","11066":"GMs are scared about his lack of arm strength and small hands I guess. He\u2019s going to be a steal wherever he goes imo, he\u2019ll find his way into a starting job eventually.","11067":"Seems the most QB needy teams got theirs in the 1st rd more than anything.","11068":"Keep in mind those stats were against defenses stacking the box as much as possible and daring Georgia to pass pretty much every game. He wasn\u2019t asked to do a lot and had Nick Chubb, Sony Michel, and Deandre Swift to hand off to his whole career. Georgia\u2019s o line was also incredibly stacked (3 first round picks in 3 years). Easy to have good looking stats when all your receivers are one on one the whole game and you can play super conservative the whole game due to your run game and top defense.","11069":"Fromm only makes the throws you expect him to make. Doesn\u2019t have a sharp edge or surprise factor to him. I feel like GM\u2019s would be scared that their offense would be too dull with him.","11070":"Top heavy conference, we do this every year","11071":"I\u2019ve seen tons of Georgia games thanks to the lady and he just really struggles with accuracy outside the numbers. Lots of the time they designed some dump offs to Swift or quick slants. Ask him to really make a long accurate throw and he just isn\u2019t very good at it unlike some of these other guys.","11072":"Bears plz","11073":"Belichick taking him in the 6th.","11074":"Is that the new nickname? JLo? I\u2019ll get behind it","11075":"Falk got cut the week Sam came back.","11076":"Gase loves him. He's clearly still going to be #2. I doubt Morgan wins the #2 job.\n\nI didn't want people commenting back \"NO WAY MORGAN WINS #2 OVER SOMEONE WITH EXPERIENCE PLUS MORGAN IS ALREADY 23 HE'S OLD FOR A ROOKIE DARNOLD IS ONLY 22\"\n\nI probably just shouldn't have even commented lol","11077":"TAHITI!!!","11078":"To be fair it's only because there's never been such an unlucky situation where a QB so low on the depth chart had to play against real NFL starters. Poor guy got put in an extremely shitty situation.","11079":"Made Brooks Bollinger look like fucking Steve Young.","11080":"Hackenburg was pretty bad, I think I liked luke better than him..","11081":"Yep. I think Fitzpatrick has the best life. He\u2019s started enough that he\u2019s had an awesome time but also gets to be the backup for so many teams because he\u2019s a good locker room and QB room guy.","11082":"best jobs*","11083":"Josh McCown sure seemed to enjoy it. I miss Uncle Josh. :(","11084":"Trickle down bangin","11085":"That basically means squabbling for practice squad spots with dozens of other QBs though","11086":"Going from him to Minshew at WSU was complete night and day in terms of mobility.","11087":"If your team isn't doing well, at least you can be happy about your rival's misery.","11088":"Damn","11089":"Shambleception","11090":"It\u2019s 2020, what isn\u2019t in shambles?","11091":"I'd wager burrow is probably better","11092":"Probably not, but they are better prospects","11093":"I would take Fromm over Morgan and arguably Hurts, but other than that I like all of the other QB's taken more than Fromm.","11094":"Hey, and even AJ McCarron has been in the league for 6 years","11095":"I do, I watched every college game Jake Fromm played and even went to several","11096":"I think you guys should take him give nice insurance to when Matt Ryan makes that decision and Ryan won't have to worry about being pushed out.","11097":"I do think he will start some games in the NFL, but I doubt he'll go into any season being the starter.","11098":"yeah, only 5 of the top 14, such a trash conference :(","11099":"the thing is, so do these other QBs lol\n\nMorgan completed 58% of his passes last year on a *lower* yards per attempt","11100":"Uh, what? As a Georgia fan, the best route he throws is the out route. Like it\u2019s not even close. He misses short throws sometimes but can always seem to hit a 15 yard out. Doesn\u2019t always put zip on the ball, but it\u2019s always accurate.","11101":"Nah they would\u2019ve taken him in the first if they wanted him. \/s","11102":"It was decided the morning after thanks to [this fantastic meme](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/MslJsof.jpg).","11103":"Yup, A-Rod and J-Lo","11104":"I'd get behind JLo","11105":"Bryce petty went 1-9 only winning against a 49ers team that lost 13 in a row.","11106":"Yeah but we only had to watch him in preseason. They were comparable QBs though I agree. I was just counting regular season","11107":"Hackenberg might legitimately be the worst player to ever make an NFL roster.\n\nFucking Mike Maccagnan.","11108":"Fitzpatrick has been a journeyman starter, not a back up. He's actually only been back up for a short period of time.\n\nChase Daniels is a great example of career back up.","11109":"And apparently somewhere in the $30+ million career earning range.","11110":"i think fitzpatrick has been a starter for more of his career than a backup. The bit about being a backup being the cushiest gig cuz you get the money without taking the hits doesn't really apply to him","11111":"Sounds like the job Fromm was born to have","11112":"That's what made the Foles\/Minshew thing fascinating to me\n\nMinshew would escape everything and make magic happen, and Foles would just... stand there","11113":"Shamblecon has been cancelled","11114":"Tua was during the SEC championship game too","11115":"HOT  \nTAKE","11116":"Big, if true.","11117":"You would take Fromm over Hurts? I hate Hurts now that he is with Philly but he has a lot more playmaking ability than Fromm","11118":"Oh yeah, I'm not saying they're terrible, I'm just saying neither is going to be as good as their college stats make them seem. Both backup level","11119":"Then I don't think it's that surprising? I saw him in person 3x too and he's very good at processing wtf is going but he misses outs, throws late in a window, and airmails screens waaay too often for the NFL. College Josh Allen consistency on short plays but without the insane ones to make up for it. \n\nAs a fan of a uGA rival I'm glad he's gone. He was mentally good enough to overcome his lack of physical tools even as a freshman. But playing Fromm in the NFL to me feels like accepting a close loss, almost guaranteed. Eason you'll at least win or lose in style.","11120":"Then it shouldn't be surprising lmao","11121":"For UGA, yeah winning in-confrence is impressive, but its not that hard to put up counting stats when there's 3 good teams on your schedule. Not that they're all that reliable for evaluation anyway","11122":"Morgan has the stereotypical physical traits NFL scouts drool over.","11123":"Really? I always thought his crossing route accuracy was pretty good but would always struggle with the out route. That\u2019s what I remember at least","11124":"Oh. My. God. The Packers are drafting for the memes. I love it.","11125":"It\u2019s so perfect! I\u2019ve been cursed by A-A-Ron to even think about Rodgers as A-Rod until now","11126":"It felt like a 1 week season. Sure it got fun later on in the year, but we were dead for the playoffs after the announcement of his status.","11127":"Maybe I\u2019m looking back on it too fondly, I remember hope around falk, but it was a while ago","11128":"Ehhhh Nathan Perryman asked to hold his beer","11129":"i envy that guy more than the high paid starters","11130":"Yeah I really dislike when people calls Fitz a backup. He's always been a starter, he was just never the franchise started.","11131":"Yeaaa.... not excited about Ifedi being our only real addition to the oline in Chicago so far for that reason.","11132":"Shamblegate","11133":"Its basically a toss up for me, I think skill wise they're pretty much equal","11134":"yes, afterall no two humans have ever disagreed with an evaluation of an athlete after watching the same tape","11135":"Georgia literally played 5 top 7 teams this season lol (and went 4-1 against them)","11136":"Not at all. It even became a meme among UGA fans that every single game the commentators would bring up how well he throws the out route.","11137":"I\u2019m starting to come around tbf","11138":"Look at how much each offense scored last year. Yeah Oklahoma plays in the easier conference but Georgia just kinda sucked passing wise","11139":"I mean, he shit the bed vs a shit SCAR team, played poorly against LSU (albeit they went undefeated), played ok against ND, solid against Auburn, and good against Baylor. He's a total game manager. Poor man's Alex Smith, aka white Mark Sanchez, thats why he's slipping","11140":"Terrible comparison","11141":"According to ESPN, the best player remaining is Jake Fromm.\n\nThe results of me watching Jake Fromm last year determined that was a lie.","11142":"Booger has a son???","11143":"BIADASZSZSSZZFFS WAS RIGHT THERE YOU FUCKS","11144":"As a Terps fan, we will not regret this","11145":"Welp, add to our stable of mediocre running backs","11146":"Not Booger\u2019s son","11147":"This dude was offensive rookie of the year on my Madden team for whatever that's worth.","11148":"How have we not taken a lineman yet? It is our biggest need!","11149":"[When we play the steelers this year and AntMac gets the ball](https:\/\/i.kym-cdn.com\/photos\/images\/facebook\/001\/578\/173\/f57.jpg)","11150":"And Maryland fans want to give an actual take on this guy? I figured we'd grab a RB. Want to know what we're getting.","11151":"Thanks, I hate it","11152":"Great pickup.  He's electric.  Just dealt with injuries and poor QB play at Maryland.  Has he gone to Penn State or stayed healthy he'd be talked about in the 2nd round with all the other top running backs imo","11153":"As a Maryland alum and Ravens fan...sh!t","11154":"He\u2019s dead to me now.","11155":"Why do I feel like the Steelers draft the same five players every year","11156":"Gross","11157":"He\u2019s a beast","11158":"Love this kid","11159":"Potential HOFer","11160":"Ahhh finally old Tony big tits is off the board","11161":"Tomlin's son goes to Maryland. I'm not surprised","11162":"Fucking dammit.  As a Terp, on one hand, it sucks that another Terp goes to play football for the Steelers.\n\n\nOn the other, we generally dgaf about our college football team nowadays, speaking as a current student, because they suck compared to most of the B1G.  So I can safely dislike him as long a plays for PIttsburgh.  I'm really glad Pittsburgh doesn't have a professional basketball team.","11163":"NOT BOOGERS SON \ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8\ud83d\udea8","11164":"Dudes a beast. Him running all over Ohio State two years ago was his coming out party on the national stage","11165":"Terrible.","11166":"Fuck","11167":"Booger Jr?","11168":"Wow, okay","11169":"Committee takes over the league. \n\nConsidering Ty Johnson was better in college, I wouldn\u2019t feel great about this","11170":"What to think as a steelers fan??","11171":"I wanted Dobbins but this is not bad either. He was the only Maryland player that seemed decent when I saw them play PSU.","11172":"Torched the Buckeyes two years ago.","11173":"I need Booger's analysis on this","11174":"Watched this kid at dematha, Steelers getting a monster","11175":"Oh shit that's a great add to their injury prone backfield.","11176":"The best player... to poop on perhaps","11177":"I dont think I've ever hated a qb as much as I hate jake fromm. And it's all solely from watching him play","11178":"As another QB gets drafted before him.","11179":"He's a little snot","11180":"it\u2019s not his son unfortunately","11181":"Yeah the pelicans took him number 1 last year","11182":"He's not Boogers kid. Booger was a 300 lb DT, this kid isn't even 200 lol","11183":"We need OL help please.","11184":"He better still be there at our next pick :'(","11185":"Has he still not be taken?","11186":"THANK GOD","11187":"As a Terps fan... Yeah you will. McFarland couldn't hit a hole if it hit him in the face.","11188":"He\u2019s a good compliment to Snell or Conner,  not a bad pick here","11189":"As a madden 20 franchise owner who drafted this guy, you will not regret this","11190":"He went to Dematha Catholic and has too end speed and could be a great third down back \n\nHe struggles in pass pro and running in between the numbers","11191":"*slaps roof of car*\n\nThese guys could play RB2 on any roster! Er, as long as you have a decent o-line that is!\n\n*skips over good o-line picks*","11192":"nothing, but also everything","11193":"he's always at least top 5 in my franchises","11194":"OL can be taken later.  Foster was UDFA, Fieler was UDFA, Villanueva was UDFA, Okorafor was late round.","11195":"This tells me the FO thinks Wiznewski can start at guard, but we seriously need depth at IOL.

Can line up in the slot and catch pretty well. Not sure he\u2019s an every down back and injury prone though.","11200":"I\u2019m a fan. He\u2019s definitely fast, and can make some impressive plays in space. He also catches the ball alright. But size definitely is something that hurts him here, he doesn\u2019t run inside phenomenally","11201":"Fast, one trick pony when he breaks outside and leaves people in the dust. Probably the worst RB in the class in terms of pass protection.","11202":"How are y\u2019all treating my boy McSorely?","11203":"My thoughts exactly!","11204":"*laughs in Jabba the Hutt*","11205":"Not really.

I've wanted to move on from Garrett since 2015, but I also love the loyalty the Cowboys have to coaches, I don't want to be one of those teams that churns through HCs every 2 or 3 years. And I can understand how Garrett made it a difficult decision.\n\nFirst 3 years weren't great, but he was always knocking on the playoff door. I wanted to give him one more year at the time. And it was a great year. Romo looked like an MVP. Won a playoff game. Lost a hearbreaking playoff game against one of the best with a controversial play towards the end of the game. \n\n15 was terrible, and this is where I was done, but he had no QB, I get giving him a pass.\n\n16 he was CotY. I see Garrett as a huge reason why we lost to the Packers in the playoffs though, and would have been happy to move on. Buy, it's hard to fire the CotY.\n\n17 was bad. This is where I was actually upset we didn't move on.\n\n18, bad start, good finish. Beat the Seahawks in the playoffs. Team  just wasn't even remotely prepared for the Rams. Playoff win saved his job, and he only had one year on his contract left.\n\n19. Finally gone after a disappointing season.\n\nIn hindsight, they should have moved on from Garrett a long time ago. But in the moment, it's easy to understand how he stuck around for so long. 2017 was the first year I think it was really bad to keep him. And even the following year he made it seem like a less terrible decision.","11407":"Not saying he hasn't but I think Howie is better about timing and planning every contract into the future.

I\u2019m the 4th. I\u2019ve been told my grandfather went by both Jr and II depending on the situation but I do like your explanation better.

Watt was super hyped going into the draft, and he way surpassed the hype.","11426":"Claiborne wasn't terrible though. He just didn't live up to the hype and the trade it took to get him. Also he was hurt a lot.  He was ok as a CB when he was on the field and made it through his first full contract without being traded\/cut.\n\nBut Taco couldn't even get on the field at times.

Stephen's specialty is getting players to sign relatively team friendly deals. Deals the team can get out of earlier than the average contract if needed. He signed Tryon Smith to an 8 year deal for damn cheap, and that's looking pretty fucking great right now. Every contract the Cowboys sign with Stephen in charge has been about the future as mush as the now. Even Amari and Zeke. Amari's deal can be dumped after 2021, and Zeke's after 2022.\n\nAnd I'm not sure you can say Howie is better about planning every contract into the future when the Eagles are currently projected to be over $25M *over* the cap in 2021.","11438":"Bryce: I CAN CHANGE","11439":"Haha true that, I wanna see that team succeed for my dude AJ Green!","11440":"I don't know, its just something Gardner Minshew Jr. the Second of his Name said once.\n\nhttps:\/\/www.sbnation.com\/nfl\/2019\/9\/26\/20881616\/gardner-minshew-flint-dad-jacksonville-jaguars-quarterback","11441":"No, anyone doing that is wrong with their usage.","11442":"Just different than what I\u2019m used to seeing.

Good for him I think it\u2019s a good fit","11472":"As a UW fan, I wish him the best of luck but hopefully he won't have to play for at least a year because he definitely is not ready yet.","11473":"ANDREW LUCK IN SHAMBLES.\n\nFrom the Colts offensive line, not the pick.","11474":"Imagine drafting a QB in the 4th round\n\nFUCK YOU HOWIE\n\nAGAIN","11475":"Still available according to ESPN shitty ass coverage \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","11476":"Now go learn from dad!! \n\nColts fans you better be calling him dad","11477":"\ud83e\udd80 QB PICK \ud83e\udd80","11478":"I wish more comments were from fans of these guys team giving short breakdown of what's good and bad instead of 99% meme comments.","11479":"It pops up \u201ccolts pick Jacob Eason\u201d\n\nMel 5 seconds later \u201cCan\u2019t believe Jacobs still on the board\u201d","11480":"At some point it becomes a value pick, so even the people who aren't big Eason fans can't be too upset with this.

At worst, he\u2019s a solid backup.","11491":"At this spot this is a steal. Was projected to go in the 2nd round by nearly everyone\n\nLet him sit a year or two and he has massive potential.

Time to grow with a vet ahead of him who has been in the league forever. I think it will work out as long as he does not consult Phil for birth control advise.","11516":" Eason to Indy? Bill Belichick's dog in shambles.","11517":"Good spot for him. Hes got the physical tools to be a star, but  he needs to sit for awhile if hes got any chance at being successful. Gets to sit behind one of the best and learn, and when he does get to play itll be behind a great offensive line with solid weapons around him if these picks pan out.","11518":"There seems to be a lot of people saying he could have used another year at Washington, but thankfully he'll now be transferring to the University of Phillip Rivers for his final year of eligibility.","11519":"Holy shit a team that actually needs a quarterback","11520":"Good Luck in Indy Eason, hope to see him start in a couple years.","11521":"Great place for him. I still maintain he'll be the best QB in the draft and said months ago that if he goes somewhere where he can sit behind a vet (was thinking Brady or Fitzpatrick) he'll develop into a star.\n\nDecent chance he beats Rivers out of the starting job even, and if he does Hilton and Pittman will feast. \n\nEason will go down as that mid round QB that every QB needy team will get mocked for passing on (and who every team will swear up and down they were JUST about to pick him next).","11522":"I actually think thats a really good value pick.

Dont want to force the issue at QB","11531":"Jacob Eason is a prototype from a bygone era and the fact that he gets to sit behind a similar player in Rivers is a great fit.","11532":"Dude has a cannon. But also has the accuracy of a cannon. Colts are probably the best fit for him tbh","11533":"Great value from someone projected to go in the 2nd round. Let\u2019s go Colts.","11534":"Andrew Luck died for this.","11535":"It's kinda crazy how far this guy fell. \n\nBefore his senior year in highschool there was a shit ton of hype. Like the dude was suppose to come to UGA play for three and get drafted #1 overall. \n\nAfter Mark Richt was let go there were a lot of UGA fans worrying that they would lose this guy cause after Richt was let go he opened up recruitment again and supposedly Florida and Miami were now competing with UGA. In retrospect, he should have gone to Miami where Richt was but a lot of people would stuff differently in retrospect. \n\nLike Kirby Smart had to announce he would still run pro-style offense to keep Eason. \n\nEason struggled a little freshman year like freshman do but dude had a game winning drive against Mizzou and through out the season you saw the arm strength hype. \n\nFromm came in and there was some competition but Eason was the starter and then you know what happened. Then he transferred back home waited a year and finally played a season and then the coach he came for retired. I think had UWs coach not retired I think Eason would have came back the senior year. \n\nA guy who was suppose to go #1 Overall in 2019 draft goes in the fourth round. That is humbling as fuck.","11536":"No other QBs taken until the fourth round really only makes the Love and Hurts picks look even worse.","11537":"Crazy he's drafted before Fromm","11538":"That true fact...?","11539":"wow","11540":"ESPN is mad he didn\u2019t go to New England considering they kept trying to give them a QB every time they picked","11541":"See ya later Jacoby","11542":"Colts receivers now become the betting favorite to have a football lodged in their sternum after a 5 yard buttonhook","11543":"Huh, a selection for backup to be a QB of the future in the 4th. This is a good place for it. Who knew?","11544":"He gets to develop behind Rivers and Brissett, good landing spot","11545":"Can someone give me a NFL comparison or what his play style is? I heard he's a big armed QB","11546":"He's gonna be so GOOD in Indy.","11547":"Oh no no no no no","11548":"as a dolphins fan i just want to say thank you colts! I was scared the Patriots would do their evil magic with him.","11549":"Good spot for Eason. Has Frank Reich and Rivers to learn from and great weapons if need be.","11550":"For some reason, despite liking clemson and alabama and therefore hating the living fuck out of Georgia, I want to see Fromm succeed. Hoping he would go here because it\u2019s, imo, the best place for a young QB","11551":"Really like the pick. I wish we could\u2019ve gotten him","11552":"THere's the project for Reich","11553":"Fuck. yes.","11554":"Steal of a pick. He's a stud.","11555":"He has a huge arm, probably the best in the draft class. Supposedly, he's a little lazy and unmotivated. He's also picked up an awful habit of drifting back in the pocket, a trait helped ruin RGIII's career. \n\nHis ceiling is about Jay Cutler. His floor is Ryan Mallet.","11556":"This dude know how to launch the ball, the UW games I went to this year it was crazy how effortless he made long throws look. His biggest issue I believe was decision making. It seemed he keyed in on one receiver and just watched him even if he had a man open in the flat he\u2019d always try to make a splash play, which didn\u2019t work out some of the time. Great pick for the colts though, I could see him progressing into a decent starter eventually","11557":"Colts having a draft this year","11558":"Nicely done! Colts got the QB everyone mocked to them but they got him at a good value!","11559":"H O T S N A K E","11560":"Great situation. Sits behind Rivers for a year and then might possibly have a shot to start. Good for everyone. I'm still a believer in Eason too so I think this might legit work out.

ESPN fully forgot to mention who we even picked.","11569":"RIP Brisett","11570":"Surprised they picked him over Jake Fromm State Farm","11571":"Nice pick, get him with a true QB guru (no idea if the colts have such a coach) and Eason might eventually develop into something special. The arm is golden.","11572":"Aw man I was hoping Fromm would go before Eason and they'd cut to the camera in Eason's house.","11573":"Before Fromm?  The guy who beat him out at Georgia..","11574":"Alright UW peeps. What's the dirt on this guy.","11575":"FYI Fromm did beat out Eason in 2017, but Eason also got hurt in UGA\u2019s opener that season. Fromm took over, and just kept winning.","11576":"As a Washington alumnus I was really excited to see this kid play this year, but he was a major let down. He has a big arm for sure but seriously lacks touch and had a really hard time connecting on intermediate\/deep sideline throws. Tendency to try to force it into tight coverage and a little indecisive as well. Holds onto the ball too long at times because he\u2019s always looking for the home run. \n\nI knew he was going to come out because he wants to get paid and I don\u2019t blame him, but he didn\u2019t look ready for the NFL at all. Sitting behind rivers for 1-2 years will be good but I\u2019m not sure how much rivers has left in the tank. The good news is that the colts are stacked so they probably won\u2019t be asking him to win, but more to manage the game and not lose it for them if he has to step up. \n\nHe can be special but he has a long way to go.","11577":"LETS. FUCKING. GO.","11578":"Value pick","11579":"Why does nobody ever talk about the fun facts reddit puts on these graphics.

OK, now that is weird","11587":"Qbs in the 4th round never work out","11588":"I\u2019m not a fan of project QBs like Eason but if you\u2019re gonna take him this is a good spot to do it","11589":"Brissett to the Pats confirmed","11590":"Brissett triggered","11591":"RIP the Jacoby Brissett era","11592":"Lets go!","11593":"J-Eazy. When that\u2019s his nickname I want credit.","11594":"As a Ducks and Titans fan, I am going to enjoy continuing to hate him (as far as football goes).","11595":"Dude's garbage I live 30 miles from Seattle and watch every UW and WSU game every season.  Kid's underdeveloped AF he reminds me if Paxton Lynch.  Yeah he has a big arm and a big frame.  There's a reason the last QB taken from UW was 2011 Jake Locker.  Whered he end up again? I woulda taken Anthony Gordon over this kid.","11596":"That's not what hot snakes are....jus sayin","11597":"Perfect fit, cannon of a arm.","11598":"Terrible pick. Watched him last cfb season. He has a strong arm but absolutely nothing else to offer. His decision making is poor, I would say Fromm or Gordon would've been better picks at that point.","11599":"His fathers name is Tony Eason. However, he is not Tony \"Skirt\" Eason that played for the Patriots in the 80's. Jacob is no relation to *that* Tony Eason.","11600":"Can't believe they didn't trade up for hurts in the second.   ..Kill me now...","11601":"I watched him play every game his freshman year at UGA with a patchwork o-line, a Nick Chubb who was not yet 100% and not much else, and yet he was making NFL throws as a 19 year old. Dude is money.","11602":"I wish Pittsburgh would\u2019ve drafted him or hurts","11603":"Chad Kelly gone then?","11604":"STUD.","11605":"Im sorry but am i the only one that watched Fromm take his starting job?","11606":"Good place for him","11607":"The girlfriend will be bringing her stripper shoes to Indianapolis.","11608":"Is he any good?","11609":"Should Phillip be worried?","11610":"Yeesh. Not a big fan. Definitely a guy that should have gone back to college for another year.

He's got an elite arm, just needs to work on smaller things. Decent project but a lot of tools to work with, plus he's not expected to play year 1 anyway","11620":"Gets to sit and learn behind Rivers and has Reich a former QB as his coach. Pretty ideal situation especially having a solid offensive line and receivers.","11621":"He won't be. He'll be third on the depth chart behind Brissett.

We need the real facts","11647":"It's okay. Once the QB gets picked they'll talk a out him and Fromm over the next 10 picks and not even bother to announce them.","11648":"No, he's our dad \ud83d\ude2d","11649":"is it cool as a colts fan since 1998 to call him Fucker Asshole","11650":"As a Patriots fan, it really confused me that his dad's name is Tony... but it's NOT the same Tony Eason that played QB for the Pats in the 80's! (Also, looking into it further, the Pats QB was actually named Charles, but went by Tony for some reason?)\n\nBased on Super Bowl XX though... probably for the best that's not his dad.","11651":"They said they didn\u2019t want any of QBs left","11652":"I count 4 \"X in shambles\" comments already","11653":"I\u2019ve watched him since his Elite 11 days. He has a massive arm. Has very little touch on the ball, he slings it no matter what. Poor decision-making, could have used another year at Washington.\n\nHowever, I think he is going to be good, if he learns from Rivers and refines his decision-making, a high quality starter in the league.","11654":"Watched every UW game last year here\n\nEason can throw from anywhere from the field; this guy has a legit cannon. \n\nBut he is not very mobile; accuracy not very good. Made poor choices throughout the season. He forced a lot of passes that turned into picks\/pick 6","11655":"Okay, UW fan here. Basics:\n\n- guy has every physical tool you could ever want. He'd just casually make one or two throws every single game where you just go 'oh, that's why people think this dude could be first round pick'.\n\n- right after that, he'll turn around and airmail a routine pass or get spooked in the pocket. His accuracy is...okay, but his pocket sense\/presence is *not* good.\n\n- in a weird way, he makes the routine look spectacular and the spectacular look routine\n\n- he doesn't have a major issue with turnovers so his decision making isn't terrible, he just never looks comfortable somehow","11656":"Cannon arm with zero touch","11657":"Blah blah ShAmBLeS","11658":"UW fan.  Prototypical size and huge arm.  Struggled to make good decisions with the ball and anticipate passes.  An offense which was elite under Jake Browning became stagnant with a much more physically gifted qb.","11659":"This sub has sucked during the draft. It\u2019s either meme comments or an anti espn circlejerk comment \n\nHow bout we actually talk about the pick?","11660":"As a CU grad who is at UW for grad school, Eason is basically Montez but miles better imo. Some decision making problems, some pocket problems, but can toss a fuckin ball.","11661":"Problem is the next player will be drafted in like 4 minutes and everyone will move on.  When you have very limited time memes will rain supreme since by the time someone finishes a breakdown the next pick will be out.","11662":"Mortensen said he dropped this far due to high concerns on work ethic and accountability issues but that he is high level talent","11663":"Idk what it is but this year it seems especially juvenile","11664":"I am a fan of his rivals... But he has a lot of talent. Very high upside. It's just that he's not very good at evading pressure. Just a bit of pressure can really rattle him. Very strong arm, and quite accurate. His biggest nock is his work ethic though from what I hear.\n\nIf he sits for a few years, gets better, and that OL gets improved, I think he has a really good chance to becoming a starter.","11665":"He reminds me of Drew Brees, as crazy as that sounds. Have seen him make some outstanding throws.\n\nThey need to give him one full year to develop - I think he has immense potential. Knowing Ballard, they\u2019ll do that and now the Colts have a new franchise QB.","11666":"Yeah reddit sucks on draft day. Best bet is going to individual team subreddits where there is less circle jerk. \n\nYou were great in dallas buyers club btw.","11667":"Commercial breaks during Colts draft picks.  A tradition unlike any other.","11668":"Definitely. Its the 4th round and youre getting a guy that was projected in the first 2 a year ago. He's extremely raw and has skills that cant be coached. He doesnt even need to be the backup, and gets to sit behind a great veteran player with a similar style. If he develops and is able to be coached up, you get a steal. If he doesnt, no one will remember using a 4th rounder in a year.","11669":"If he turns into a solid back up, its still a great pick. I was hoping he'd fall to us","11670":"And now he's on a team with a Jacoby. How fucking weird.","11671":"are we just going to ignore that he might be one of the most evil men on the planet? I'm calling the police","11672":"Isn't he going to be a PS guy this season?","11673":"Ah yes. We are into the \u201cit's a steal because I know who that is\u201d part of the draft.","11674":"Maybe at the start of the year but he fell to a 3\/4th after the college season and then slightly bumped up again after the combine.\n\nBut yeah prototypical strong arm\/size lack of IQ\n\nMost likely is the next Paxton Lynch though.  Can't see him putting it together","11675":"> He has the best arm in the draft but his decision making is awful\n\nSo, ideal for the Colts.","11676":"Better than burrow? I was under the impression love could sling it as well.","11677":"Sounds like DeShone Kizer to me.","11678":"Who the fuck is Mel Kiper, anyway","11679":"Phillip Rivers in SHAMBLES","11680":"w o w","11681":"Wow","11682":"Imagine how many kids he'll have once he's retired. The man will singlehandedly creampie his way to post-Covid repopulation.","11683":"Well...he is on a 1 year deal","11684":"To be fair, our next pick could have been Hurts, and the league could be valuing him a lot higher than the public has.","11685":"Sorry about your draft","11686":"And where the Eagles could have drafted Hurts :(","11687":"He would have been better than anyone y'all had when Ben went down. Where does he go now though?","11688":"Yeah I feel the same, don\u2019t necessarily want him but also wouldn\u2019t want anyone else over him.","11689":"Hope you\u2019re right. Optimist in me thinks he can be russell Wilson esque steal in fourth round.","11690":"Really makes you wonder how things would\u2019ve turned out if Eason didn\u2019t go down vs App State.","11691":"Well Kelly just lost his roster slot, so probably him lol","11692":"Or it proves that Love and Hurt were more valued than the other qb\u2019s being picked now.","11693":"Is it? He was given a higher draft grade than Fromm...","11694":"Yeah, uh, what the heck?","11695":"big ben","11696":"I hope he saved some of the $30m dollars he got last year to wipe his tears","11697":"I wish I was a NFL quarterback","11698":"over tua?","11699":"I mean Dwayne Haskins beat out Joe Burrow and if they were in the same draft you\u2019d be insane to take Haskins over Burrow","11700":"Fromm also \u201cbeat out\u201d Fields. Kirby is a defensive coach","11701":"Solid arm. But he only throws it at one speed which is 100mph.\n\nHis college receivers did not help him AT ALL and couldnt catch anything. Maybe that changes in the NFL but he has to learn some touch.\n\nHes like a Madden player learning for the first time how to use each type of throw. The potential is there but I'd say hes just meh","11702":"Lol","11703":"He is sometimes good and sometimes terrible. He can make any throw. But sometimes it\u2019s way too hard of a pass, sometimes to the wrong person, etc.","11704":"he got a big arm but completely crumbles under pressure so its 50\/50","11705":"Well worth a 4th","11706":"Physically? Yes.  Mentally? Questionable. Decent value pick with a good upside if he can be developed.","11707":"Lol no. Eason is a huge project","11708":"If you're being serious (sorry if you are hard to tell sometimes) no Rivers shouldn't be worried if Eason is on the field we're trying to get a good draft pick to get our actual QB of the future","11709":"> Definitely a guy that should have gone back to college for another year.\n\nHe's transferring to Philip Rivers Institute of Technology.","11710":"Weeps in green","11711":"Smiles in silver & blue.","11712":"Wouldn't be bad to go to a team that has a veteran QB and a former QB in a HC.","11713":"\u201cElite arm\u201d is an understatement.  Dude has an absolute cannon.","11714":"Will Rivers be a good mentor for him this year?","11715":"UW guy here, I like Eason and hope he succeeds but he just never seemed fully engaged. \n\nI know part of that is because he spent the season here auditioning for the NFL but he spent two years in our system, one as a redshirt, and they still had to scale down the playbook.\n\nHe clearly has the physical tools but I don't know if he has the mental dedication.","11716":"Love the pick too. Just gotta wonder what in the fuck Brisset is thinking. First four weeks last year he was the future dude and everyone was all about him. Now they sign Philipe Rijos and draft a dude.....hes gotta be salty as fuck.","11717":"Can someone give one example where a big arm qb actually figured out the \u201clittle things.\u201d ?\n\nI would argue these are not the little things, they are also big things like accuracy and decision making.","11718":"He instantly is one of the strongest arms in the NFL. \n\nPerfect twin to PRivers.","11719":"He really really needs a good line. Right now his pocket presence isn\u2019t great and he\u2019s as quick as Brady.","11720":"Having watched a bunch of his games, I feel that he would make a *great* backup QB. He has the potential to have a great and relatively safe career in the NFL. \n\nHe will need a while to adjust to the pace of the NFL. He struggled a lot under pressure and in the NFL pressure comes a lot faster. \n\nIf he develops his mental game, he could easily see himself making $5mil a year for the next 15 years to play two games a year. And those teams will be quite thankful that he won't lose games for them in the meantime.\n\nOn the more positive side, if he can keep his head in the game under pressure, he could find himself well above the Dalton Line as a starter as well.","11721":"One of those low floor, high ceiling type of picks. Not bad for round 4.","11722":"He can sling the rock. Dumb as a brick though.","11723":"You think the colts keep 3 qbs on the roster?","11724":"Not with Grigson at the helm","11725":"Luck's gonna live the rest of his life afraid of getting blindsided.","11726":"Definitely not in the pocket if you play for the colts.","11727":"10,000 feet in the air and I can still see this dub bossman.","11728":"You're an all star","11729":"Love Hurts.","11730":"I\u2019d say it Jalens","11731":"He'll be singing a different tune if Wentz ever gets Hurts, again","11732":"It\u2019s like these fans want to put Howie in Jalen locked up for such a crime.","11733":"Hard to be much worse than a duck and a guy with a helmet shaped dent in his head.","11734":"Hah, jokes on you! We took some RB I've never heard of!","11735":"shut","11736":"My man's hairline collapsed in on itself after that pick","11737":"Why can't Bills fans say that Howie got us a ring?","11738":"Wentz got us that ring too. It\u2019s just such a shocking pick. People are gonna be pissed","11739":"Not everyone can have a starting QB as good as Trubisky so we have to make do","11740":"That's really hilarious especially coming from a Bears fan","11741":"Hurts won\u2019t play QB in the NFL.","11742":"Glass houses lmao.","11743":"Right? I think Hurts is a better long term pick.","11744":"reminds me of Nikola Jokic getting drafted during a Taco Bell commercial\n\nkinda ironic all things considered","11745":"Ya that happens to the colts every year. Happened twice I think last year. Gotta imagine happens to a lot of small market teams.","11746":"NFL Network is streaming ESPN's draft coverage tho","11747":"It\u2019s a simulcast this year","11748":"Its the same exact show lol","11749":">The NFL network is the only way to watch ~~Day 3 of~~ the draft\n\nFIFY","11750":"Fox is actually the one with good coverage.","11751":"I like bleacher reports coverage","11752":"Fine he\u2019s their stepdad","11753":"We are all children of Felipe Rios","11754":"We were like \"Ok, but we're not calling him Dad!\"","11755":"Ballard said he wouldn't force a QB. I think he views this as the point where he can give a guy a shot without feeling like he's picking \"QB of the future\"","11756":"Ballard is sly fucker. I love him.","11757":"\"Oh I meant we didn't want any of the left QBs, we were only looking for the right QB \ud83d\ude0e\"","11758":"They said they weren\u2019t committed to them. Kid\u2019s gonna have to work to stick here.","11759":"When did he say that?","11760":"These types of comments. Thank you.","11761":"Really needed one more yeat at Washington, if he improved his decision making and pocket presence he could have easily been a 1st round pick in 2021. With that said, sitting behind philip rivers is the perfect place from him.","11762":"Rivers also slings it so curious if that will still be a problem.","11763":"A lot of his issues are things that Rivers excels at so hopefully he learns from Rivers.","11764":"I'm trying to think how many cannon-arms, poor-decision making prospects actually develop into above average starters? I could be off but I feel like decision making is the one thing that just doesn't develop in the NFL, but I'm open to hearing of counter examples.","11765":"What does that mean, \u201ctouch\u201d?","11766":"I'll welcome the 60 yards Hail Mary to win the SB.","11767":"> - in a weird way, he makes the routine look spectacular and the spectacular look routine\n\nJohnny Manziel also had this ability.","11768":">  An offense which was elite under Jake Browning\n\nuhh...what?","11769":"I really like it from a value play. I was interested in trading from 13 to 7 if Miami didn't take Tua so the Colts could have picked up one of Herbert \/ Tua, but obviously that wasn't on the cards and turning 13 into Buckner was great value. With Rivers signing on, we could afford to wait on a project player like Eason. Let's say the Colts start like 2-5 next season and Rivers is actually done. Roll with Eason, and if he sucks we'll pick in the top 10 and have another roll of a QB. Alternatively, if Rivers does well then this is moot and whatever we get out of Eason is gravy. All the UW people say he has arm talent for days but no head. Perfect - he's an upgraded swag kelly. Totally worth a 4th and I'm a huge fan of this pick.","11770":"Last year was too, this sub sure likes acting like it\u2019s way above r\/nba in terms of quality even though it\u2019s basically the same sub.","11771":"I guess it\u2019s better than a damn monkey announcing our pick","11772":"Precisely","11773":"Oh absolutely","11774":"Probably. With the off-season and the lack of team activities, it makes sense to keep Jacoby as the primary backup while giving Eason at least a year to kick back and learn. Probably the end of Swag Kelly in Indy though lol","11775":"Well he was a 5* recruit and the #1 QB prospect of his class, hardly played in college due to injuries but briefly showed elite arm talent and horrible awareness\n\nHe has everything you can't teach and he has a good personality. Perfect QB prospect for the 3rd-5th round","11776":"I forgot how unbearable NFL draft coverage is in the days immediately after the draft. Everyone who has been shitting on mock drafts for months suddenly decides they\u2019re the gospel and if an actual NFL team deviates from it then they\u2019re either a genius for getting a steal of someone that was mocked earlier or they\u2019re an idiot for reaching for someone that people had mocked later","11777":"Paxton Lynch had zero work ethic. That\u2019s an awful comparison.\n\n\nIn Easons case when they say he has questionable work ethic that is more related to his time at Georgia when he loved partying. Think that changed when he went to Washington.","11778":"Isn\u2019t the situation he\u2019s going to a bit safer than Paxton\u2019s situation though?","11779":"What do you mean, DeShone has the mind of Tom Brady","11780":"[Garafolo] Longtime Chargers and current Colts quarterback Phillip Rivers announces his retirement on Instagram following the Jacob Eason pick.","11781":"I don't like this comment","11782":"In 500 years, a fun fact people will like to talk about is how 50% of the population is descended from Philip Rivers","11783":"Yeah dude it sucks. I think if we shored up the defense and picked up Mims or Duvernay or Shenault we could have got Rodgers his 2nd ring.","11784":"I'd take him over Duck rn, so if hes cut I'd be happy to have him","11785":"I just mean because Fromm took his job at Georgia","11786":"i can tell you don't watch \/cfb\/","11787":"So he\u2019s fat and slow?","11788":"Me too lol","11789":"Tua wins it in 4 years after coming back from injury the previous year. Duh.","11790":"He also only signed a one year deal, so I definitely don\u2019t think he\u2019s too concerned.","11791":"I wouldn\u2019t say huge but there\u2019s no way Eason sees the field in a meaningful way this season.","11792":"*laughs maniacally in blue*","11793":"Reicht is Top 5 when it comes to head coaches developing QBs right now imo, it really showed when all the Philly coaches went their separate ways after the Super Bowl","11794":"Yall got such a good coach its unreal. I think its a great fit for eason.","11795":"As a UGA alum, this was part of the problem. He had no touch on the ball. Every throw was 100mph. I hope that\u2019s something that can be corrected but I have no idea.","11796":"With 0 dial or finesse.","11797":"I mean he\u2019s probably gonna treat him like his kid and help him out.","11798":"Philip emphasized heavily that he wants to be a good teammate first. So, part of that should be mentoring a rookie.","11799":"Probably, never hurts to have a HOF QB on the roster while you\u2019re learning the ropes.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to note that it\u2019s not only Rivers, it\u2019s Brissett, who is also the polar opposite in terms of Rivers. Brissett is conservative, Rivers will air it out whenever he wants.\n\nLot of different viewpoints to soak in.","11800":"Tbh rivers seems like a bit of a dickhead but he has oodles and boodles of experience.","11801":"Good to know.  Knowing Ballard and Reich, they will give him a hard look.  If it doesn't work, oh well.  Better to get burned on a 4th rounder rather than a 1st or 2nd.","11802":"I had to re-evaluate how I felt about Jake cause I was sure Eason would be better then him.  Jake's throwing motion was hard to watch but he was a fucking winner.","11803":"Agreed, he seemed like he was going to be AMAZING, but the last year it just seemed like he was \"out of it\". I really hope he kills it, love my Huskies doing well.","11804":"Apparently scouts labeled him with \"Attitude and work ethic issues\". Sounds on par with your comment.","11805":"Thats exactly how I felt about his time at UGA too, was hoping that aspect of his game would improve once he moved elsewhere","11806":"He\u2019s a dolt and has a giant ego.  He\u2019s literally a stereotypical high school star qb","11807":"That's a nice way of saying he's dumb as a brick.","11808":"He had his chances. Teams figured us out and how much we schemed to \u201cprotect\u201d Jacoby from his weaknesses and he started to look worse every week.","11809":"Idk what to tell him, though. I mean... play better?","11810":"he did himself no favors though","11811":"He shoulda played better","11812":"Was he really \"the future dude\" or just a fill in during a very precarious situation. Luck retired in the middle of preseason. That didn't leave the Colts much time to explore real options.","11813":"Is Brisset still on the team?","11814":"I'd say he's thinking \"Bill, pick up the phone!\"","11815":"Ben Rothlisberger? Cam Newton? Patrick Mahomes?","11816":"Unless Jacoby is traded definitely","11817":"yep.  if rivers goes down, we won't throw Eason to the wolves.  unless someone wants Brissett and makes a too good to pass trade offer.  we could still sign another backup in that scenario for a year with our cap","11818":"yes","11819":"Yeah, definitely. They're not going to trust Eason to come in and be the backup right away.","11820":"Patriors makes sense for Brissette","11821":"I think most teams should. Look what happened to the Steelers last year. You never know when your QB will be knocked out.","11822":"Its not really a tough decision when one is a project. Maybe in year two they drop brisset.","11823":"Pats did and won 6 superbowls with the guy","11824":"We don\u2019t say that name.","11825":"Please...not that song.","11826":"Howie want a rockstarrrrr okay","11827":"Packers fans feeling this","11828":">put Howie in Jalen  \n  \nAre we still doing phrasing?","11829":"Jale","11830":"You've obviously never seen Fromm play.","11831":"this literally made me LOL","11832":"My flair has nothing to do with it lol","11833":"No way. Wentz is legit. Hurts we no zero idea on him.","11834":"Ironic? You mean appropriate.","11835":"It baffles me that they treat the later rounds the way they do. Do they think casual fans are watching these rounds?","11836":"They skipped over the Cowboys pick too though, and simply showed the Steelers on the clock afterwards without announcing our pick. I had to wait for the name thing at the bottom to scroll all the way to pick 123. Stupid.","11837":"And has the last two days. We get one set of coverage this year.","11838":"Exactly, the NFL Network crew does it so much better then ESPN, that was his point","11839":"We're calling him Mr. Rivers","11840":"He certainly has enough of them.","11841":"Yeah everyone took \"don't force a QB pick\" to mean they didn't like any of the QBs. Ballard means what he says.","11842":"And i dont think anyone could be disappointed if he wasnt the qb of the future. Eason is all ceiling he just needs work. \n\n\nOn that note is ballard the best gm in the afc south?","11843":"There\u2019s the ticket. If we were truly convinced on him, we would have drafted him in the first or second round. \n\nHe\u2019s definitely gonna have to prove himself, but it would be foolish to say that Ballard isn\u2019t committed to him, since a fourth round pick is still notable. It probably just means they\u2019re still unsure on him and think he has the potential to be a franchise guy.","11844":"I\u2019ll go the other way. He was a total meathead at Georgia and is going to struggle mightily with his reads and decision making his whole career.","11845":"Those are big ifs. His draft stock dropped this year due to his play.","11846":"I wouldn't trust Washingtons QB development at this point, and I think they had another pretty good QB prospect waiting behind him. Falling to 4th isn't ideal but I think it's far from a guarantee playing another year would help his stock","11847":"They\u2019ll cancel out","11848":"Not to the same extent but Big Ben was a gun slinger type who had some decision making issues and then completely changed his game.","11849":"He has one speed for throwing, its fast. Eason lacks touch and has difficulties in knowing what speed to throw the ball.","11850":"Remember when they made the playoff.  Beat the two bay area teams that year.  44-6 against stanford 66-27 against cal.","11851":"Some actual analysis. Thanks, I agree with you 100% super excited for Eason\n\nI think rivers will ball out behind our OL though","11852":"I wish the monkey  made Grigson's picks","11853":"Orangutan, my good sir.","11854":"He played two full seasons, and started for Washington in a weak Pac-12 last year.","11855":"That last part there sums him up perfectly. I don\u2019t expect to see him until year 3 if he\u2019s going to start.","11856":"FWIW Chris mortenson just mentioned that one of the reasons Eason fell was questionable work ethic.","11857":"Eason is known for not having the best work ethic as well.","11858":"That's one of the biggest criticisms of Eason to","11859":"According to Mortensen that was scouts worry with this guy as well though","11860":"He's also a 4th rounder compared to a 1st rounder.\n\nGranted Lynch just couldn't beat out Seimian and then they gave up on him after 2 years.","11861":"Up there with Ghengis Khan","11862":"Mims would have been nasty with Rodgers throwing to him","11863":"Well that's true","11864":"I do, but admittedly not much Pac-12. I still don't think it should be a *surprise*, though, given their draft grades.","11865":"*gives things away in BOB*","11866":"He's also so good on game day too. His playcalling always seems to have an objective and almost seemed chained together at points. Very noticeable for the Eagles  since he left they don't seem to have as cohesive a gameplan anymore.","11867":"Yeah, we picked up the wrong guy for OC in 2018.  Reicht was clearly the biggest part of the 2017 Eagles' braintrust.","11868":"He\u2019s in a great situation to learn with Rivers and Reich.","11869":"Yep, that continued to be a problem at UW. I swear, he'd rifle the ball at our poor receivers who were just 8 yards down the field.","11870":"Favre was infamous for throwing super hard. Hopefully he can learn some control.","11871":"At uw accuracy seemed a bigger problem than touch.  He struggled hitting guys in stride, or leading receivers into tacklers.  He was also really bad under pressure which is a big red flag for the NFL","11872":"This was a MASSIVE problem at UW. Hopefully NFL receivers have better hands for his sake.","11873":"> He had no touch on the ball. Every throw was 100mph.\n\nThis didn't get better at Wasington. Hopefully he gets the education and trainin he needs in Indy.q","11874":"Split evenly, that\u2019d be 2 hours a day. RIP Eason","11875":"Does he have enough time for 28 kids now?","11876":"He adopting kids now instead of making them?","11877":"Lil Jake better lock up his Uncrustables","11878":"He also said he has a 2-year maximum so it's not like he's going to be scorned by bringing in someone to develop. \n\nHe'll help out more than Rodgers will, that's for sure.","11879":"I remember he said in an interview that when it came to Easton Stick, he would definitely give him help if he wanted it, but also isn\u2019t the kinda guy always looking for people to take under his wing and thinks people grow by learning for themselves, which is super fair.","11880":"Yall don't have a HoF qb on your roster though","11881":"He's too tall, he won't work out in the NFL.  No one succeeds at 6'6\" at the position.","11882":"I\u2019m losing track of which Montlake Jake we\u2019re talking about...","11883":"There were rumors from Georgia fans that he did his fair share of coke while attending school there.","11884":"I mean yeah but he wasnt terrible....he was decent and now you get replaced by a HOF (in my opinion) and they draft a dude. You expected to be the guy and now you are thought of as nothing.","11885":"Playoff Flacco","11886":"All of those guys had at least passable skills at those skills, hence why they went in the first round.","11887":"Cam never really completely figured out his accuracy issues apart from one good season. His running was so transcendent that it made up for it. Mahomes had footwork issues but accuracy wasn\u2019t an issue and his arm is so ridiculous he can do things so it\u2019s didn\u2019t think were possible. Most of his knocks were on decision making.","11888":"Absolutely no way the colts keep 3 QBs on the active roster","11889":"I was genuinely curious I didn\u2019t know the makeup of the colts roster weather or not they could afford to or if they were gonna be in the market to trade Brisset I would imagine next offseason would be more likely for that.","11890":"Cursed name","11891":"Grigson","11892":"What's not to like [about this song?](https:\/\/youtu.be\/Nfbq9fYLy0w?t=60)","11893":"He\u2019s just Eason them in Tua nice ballad.","11894":"I feel like I\u2019m the only one who got this.","11895":"Vikings fans are Cartman licking Scott Tenorman\u2019s tears after making chili out of his parents","11896":"I have. Me gunna be big mad.","11897":"He is a decent system quarterback isn't he?","11898":"What happened with Fromm? I remember he was great his first year, and seemed to be a solid QB, but never made that huge leap","11899":"You've obviously never seen much of Duck and Rudolph.","11900":"They dropped the ball last night as well. The Falcons picked a Center, then the Jets picked a linebacker (I think, something defensive) but the graphic still had the Falcons on the clock and whatever analyst started talking kept mentioning the Falcons as taking the defensive player.\n\nAlso the few times Goodell announced receivers as running backs.","11901":"I'm usually an ESPN guy for the draft, but this year I couldn't take it because I can't stand Booger. Imagine my surprise when I flipped to NFL Network Thursday and saw the same feed.","11902":"Yup :(","11903":"I\u2019ve been listening on ESPN radio. Some horrible moments but somehow has been less annoying.","11904":"but its literally the exact same thing?","11905":"He wants us to call him Phil, but we're not ready yet","11906":"I mean, 4th rounders haven\u2019t been a lock for our roster in Ballard\u2019s tenure. I think it\u2019d be silly to think Eason won\u2019t, just because of the nature of his position and our contract situations after this season. But if a guy falls into our draft position next draft that we are higher on? Eason probably isn\u2019t going to be committed to enough to make that pick not happen.","11907":"Not really a fair comment. He came in as a legend from day one. We expected too much of him and treated him like the savior of Georgia football, that\u2019ll make anyone a meathead. He took handled being replaced better than anyone imagined, went back home to Washington and played better than he did with us. \n\nI think some play time and coaching consistency will do wonders for him","11908":"4th round pick isn't the worst place to gamble on him.  Heck, getting a servicable backup QB in the 4th round is worth it.","11909":"yeah that's 1 year out of 3 that Browning started over there. Last 2 were awful.","11910":"As far as prospects go he's a weird case of relatively few pass attempts split between 2016 and 2019 in entirely different programs. I don't think it's the best way of showcasing his potential and he probably should have stayed at UW another season","11911":"Smiles in Lock","11912":"Didn't Rivers notoriously have an absolute cannon and no touch early on in his career?","11913":"Big Q is pretty territorial.","11914":"He\u2019s a project for sure.  Also important to remember he sat out a year.","11915":"Both.  Once Rivers' kids start having kids, they'll start taking over the world exponentially by all the fucking they do.","11916":"Everyone that thought Big Ben was rude when the Steelers drafted Mason hasn\u2019t seen shit because Rodgers is going to be rightfully pissed and he seems to hold grudges","11917":"He means after the 2 SBs this year and next.","11918":"Bah God! That's Paxton Lynch's music!","11919":"Yeah. Shoulda used their last names only.","11920":"There was certainly the rumor that he was a partier and not as engaged as Fromm while they were here. \n\n\nBUT he was a great teammate after he lost the job to Fromm.","11921":"But he wasn't decent for a starter though. He filled in fine, but if the team really wants to reach its potential then Brisset is not your guy.\n\nI still think he's an elite backup, in a pinch he's a good QB to fill in. However, I think its pretty clear he isn't a guy you build around.","11922":"If Rivers makes the HOF I'll eat a shoe.","11923":"Mahomes was a bit of a project.","11924":"Basically a 100% chance, actually, lmao. Rivers and Eason are no question going to make it, and we gain nothing by cutting Brissett, and it's unlikely that any team is willing to trade for him with his salary. Might as well keep him as high level backup for one year.","11925":"Well they're not going to drop Eason after a shortened offseason. And they like Jacoby as a backup, at least enough to keep him on the roster","11926":"Worth remembering there are more roster spots this season. Not as big an ask to carry 3","11927":"Yeah i guess im not too familiar with it either. I guess he could end up on their practice squad for a year but i think he could make a serviceable back up. For his age rivers has been really healthy and hasn't missed a lot of games.","11928":"Whose side are you on","11929":"Ryan Lindley","11930":"Fuck","11931":"Waiting for WLR to drop","11932":"If the system is being on a stacked team that has wayyyyy more talent than almost every other team they play: then sure.","11933":"Having watched both their college careers, he reminds me a *lot* of Cody Kessler. Not *terrible* but just \u201ca guy.\u201d","11934":"Always struggled to throw over the middle. Had a couple wtf games last year also (South Carolina)","11935":"booger has been good","11936":"ESPN and NFL network had the exact same coverage. It was as simulcast to limit the amount of people needed to work on the production of the broadcast.","11937":"Not usually, in previous years you had Eisen running his own coverage on NFL Network","11938":"It's sillier to assume that because of a couple of our other 4th rounders worked out, Eason automatically will as well. History has no bearing on what our current pick will do.","11939":"Also he went to Lake Stevens Highschool. Automatically makes you a meathead.","11940":"Lol to be fair that's what happens with every qb at uga. Their backup is always the most popular person on campus. It's hilarious","11941":"Lol love that my opinion is not a fair comment. I\u2019m shocked he played better in the PAC 12 \/s\n\nEdit also wanna address the \u201cthat would make ANYONE a meathead....\u201d that makes no sense, Aaron Murray and Fromm are both awesome dudes that were saviors here for awhile.","11942":"Those are fair points. I will say that I think an underlying theme that makes the two seasons flow better are the reports of character concerns (lack of effort, showing up late or not at all, etc.).","11943":"*Drinks in Keim*","11944":"Jacoby most definitely does. It's why he had so many drops.","11945":"Thats true, as shown by how he treats his own agent compared to his insurance salesman.  Dude grudges, lol.","11946":"Nah, he'll treat him like family.","11947":"I think, and I could be wrong, but I think he\u2019s referring to Peyton Manning\u2026","11948":"So kinda like a less effective Nick files (without the post season success) or a Josh McCown?","11949":"Imho which is obviously nothing, he should get consideration not saying hes a lock or anything but should at the very least be talked about.","11950":"Because his mechanics and footwork were sloppy. That's easier to fix than not being able to make quick decisions.","11951":"And where do we cut the other active roster spot? They aren\u2019t keeping all three on the roster and I\u2019d say jacoby is the odd man out and he\u2019s likely to get traded especially cuz we have already paid most of his salary for this year so whoever gets him will not be paying a full 15 million","11952":"Andrew Luck","11953":"SLATT","11954":"Just FYI, he was 13-5 against ranked teams in his time there. Go watch the 2018 SEC championship game for what he could be - he was like that all the second half of 2018. He just sucked this year and no one really knows why.","11955":"He is still a man named booger","11956":"He's definitely been better than he is on MNF.","11957":"No, no, no. I need Charles Davis, Marshall Faulk, and Rich Eisen.","11958":"oh I see what you mean. I thought you meant they were doing a better job *this* year. was confused. yeah NFLN kills ESPN for the draft","11959":"Didn\u2019t mean to come across as attacking, sorry. I do think Eason shaped up in his second year. I think the way he handled being benched was incredible, especially compared to Fields.","11960":"He didn't really play that well at Washington...","11961":"The whoosh is real.","11962":"Not really. The biggest issue with Brisset is that he doesn't really have a big arm nor does he take chances down the field, so what you get is a low turnover game manager at best. The issue is, at worst you get a guy who's simply not creating any offense for you at the most important position on the field.","11963":"Sure. He just has no titles, no MVPs, and no all-pros. He has zero chance.","11964":">And where do we cut the other active roster spot?\n\nWilkins, probably. Don't need four RBs. If we can make a trade for Jacoby then that would be fine, I just really don't see it. Basically every team besides the Pats has their QB set and probably don't want to be trading draft picks for a backup on a one year deal. And the Pats don't have the space cap wise to take in Jacoby.","11965":"Santonio Holmes","11966":"I\u2019m a South Carolina fan, I\u2019ve watched him play quite a lot. \n\nHe definitely got NO help at receiver in 2019, they were comically bad at the position. Georgia\u2019s offensive game planning was also extremely boring and predictable. \n\nDespite that, I still find him to be pretty underwhelming and I don\u2019t think he has what it takes to be anything more than a serviceable back up in the NFL.","11967":"Most of what you said is accurate, but Brissett has a fucking rocket. He just refused to ever use it.","11968":"After the first 5 weeks all of the media coverage was saying otherwise. Hell most of them wanted him to get am extension","11969":"You seem to have alot of fun","11970":"There\u2019s no reason to keep 3 QBs on the active roster. Philip is the clear starter and Eason is the possible future QB learning the game. Jacoby isn\u2019t the guy moving forward so why have him sitting on the sidelines knowing he\u2019s just going to walk after the year? Either somebody is going to trade a likely later round pick for him or we cut him so he can sign somewhere they\u2019ll use him","11971":"Okay ENOUGH","11972":"Yeah, that might be true. I've just never seen it haha.","11973":"Well, the whole team was playing well then and Brisset was playing solid along with extremely low turnovers. Many were buying in because the Colts looked good. And while at the time many of us Colts fans were happy with the start, Brisset's issues were known then too. He wasn't throwing the ball downfield when he was playing well and that was an early criticism. \n\nIt obviously became exposed later in the season and with hindsight it's kind of glaring.","11974":"I don\u2019t see how anything he said makes him a party pooper. Rivers a great statistical qb, but accolades and legacy matter especially for QBs","11975":"No reason to have 4 RBs either, and as has been shown many times in recent years, a quality backup QB who can come in and not have the offense totally break down can save your season. Rivers is old and could get hurt at some point, if someone like Jacoby could come in and keep a win alive that could be a whole season changer, especially when Eason isn't going to be ready and we won't want to force him into a situation where he is unprepared for real action. Again, if someone does make a real trade offer for Jacoby I would be in favor of that, but I think that's unlikely, and I would much, much rather cut someone like Wilkins than Jacoby, Jacoby definitely has more value for us as a real backup than a 4th RB.","11976":"Remember in the Eagles game when they brought him in for the Hail Mary because of his rocket arm? \n\nRemember the Bucs game where he just unleashed that deep ball?\n\nThose are two of the instances that come to mind.","11977":"As a Seahawks fan 4 RBs is not enough lol.","11978":"This guy is a literal wall, no finesse, just stands still and guys can't get past. Great pick","11979":"HE PLAYS REALLY REALLY MEAN","11980":"BLUE TEAM TO \n\nB L U E  T E A M\n\n\ncoincidence?!","11981":"SOMEONE TELL ME HOW TO FEEEEEELLL","11982":"This is an Oline name","11983":"I, too, want to know where Old Zealand is...tell us, you cowards!","11984":"god the SEC is fucking dominating this draft","11985":"He big","11986":"6\u20196\u201d 320 lbs is something I just can\u2019t fathom. I know it\u2019s true but I\u2019ve never met a human the size of these guys.","11987":"Stenberg is a mean motherfucker. He is good for at least one personal foul per game.","11988":"IOL should be set now","11989":"Good run blocker but be prepared for many penalties.","11990":"he plays football! thats good","11991":"They drafted an OG? How old is this dude exactly?","11992":"Doesn't believe New Zealand is real? Lmao","11993":"We rapid fire mode now","11994":"These commercials are something else omg","11995":"Fuck these pizza commercials","11996":"Steal","11997":"Dammit I wanted him","11998":"His surname means \u201cStone Mountain\u201d","11999":"Beast.","12000":"Depth is always a good thing","12001":"Burgers....97....like, how?","12002":"Great player, but prepare for a lot of yellow","12003":"Someone tell me how to feel","12004":"i wanted a WR but im good with it.","12005":"256","12006":"He'll get a penalty before the game even starts lol. Lions got a good one.","12007":"Lions drafting and signing run blocking big boys. With Swift in the 2nd, I see a good amount running plays in our offense this year","12008":"Wow... great draft so far.","12009":"This offseason is going even better then last years amazing offseason.","12010":"This man is a unit, he was the only dude in our highschool that was both taller and heavier than me. \n\nHappy to see him drafted!","12011":"4th rounder for a reason,  slow feet. Maybe someone can coach him up to get him to move his big ass quickly.","12012":"Back to back Gs for us","12013":"I think not","12014":"Fried chicken to a fried team\nC O I N C I D E N C E ?","12015":"Blue team wins~","12016":"Concerned; he apparently doesn't know that Old Zealand is just called Zeeland, and it's in the Netherlands.","12017":"He\u2019s solid. He rarely got beat","12018":"love this pick - he's a run blocker that showed well in the senior bowl\n\nEDIT: oh duh plus All-SEC without giving up a sack. Pretty good I\u2019d say","12019":"Battle tested coming out of the SEC. He\u2019s massive. I\u2019d say pretty good potential","12020":"I love Logen Stenberg. Probably not a year 1 starter, but he's big, mean, and moves people.","12021":"He was one of the best O-Lineman in the SEC and IMO if he didn't have issues with penalties, we would've been a 2nd round talent. \n\nHe's guaranteed at least 1 holding call on an important drive and will make the most drive-stopping penalties imaginable where *everyone* will know his name, but then he'll bully 3 defenders out of the way to open a lane for a touchdown.\n\nI'll put it this way, he was called for holding so much that after he graduated he put out a thank you tweet to the refs for always having his number on their minds.","12022":"He lacks in the strength and physical department but gets it done every where else. He is great at Run blocking","12023":"Great. Dude is a mauler","12024":"He\u2019s someone a lot of guys love. Arguably a third round talent","12025":"Stenberg was a huge part why the UK run game has been stellar","12026":"I went to highschool with this guy, hes a good kid and plays with a real meanstreak. Hes VERY strong.\n\nHe played pretty much every game at college with zero major injuries. If he improves his passblocking he has potential to be a long term starter. He helped Benny Snell Jr break school rushing records for Kentucky.\n\nHes solid, I love me a OL man that plays mean.","12027":"In the Netherlands","12028":"kinda bummed we couldn't get him to possibly replace Glowinski","12029":"It's the Lions, we already are","12030":"he'll fit in fine then","12031":"Yeah he's basically like a budget Taylor Lewan","12032":"These facts are all fake- unless you\u2019re just appreciating what they came up with","12033":"\/r\/MapsWithoutNZ might explain some things.","12034":"So uh, that username.","12035":"Should have gone to UGA then","12036":"That can be cleaned up. Not a huge issue","12037":"Happy dudes mean","12038":"Jackson is a better pass blocker","12039":"Why","12040":"Why? We had garbage at guard before this draft.","12041":"Wow. A 4th rounder got picked in the 4th round because he was considered 4th round talent. What a hot take.","12042":"\"Fuck defense we're putting up 50\" - Quinn","12043":"Conspiracy??","12044":"Definitely not","12045":"You know, that explains a lot actually.","12046":"With the current guards on our roster, he has a decent chance at starting, lol.","12047":"Sounds great","12048":"Fits right in then. Perfect.","12049":"Whether he had penalty issues before or not, he surely will now","12050":"Yep, the refs can just pick it up","12051":"We just grabbed an OG and this team still has needs at WR, swing tackle, DB, and Edge. Strange pick in that now you got Wiggins, Aboushi, and Dahl in addition for the line.","12052":"We added Harmon Shelton Collins Okudah Okwara Trufant so far on that side of the ball.\n\nWe have just had a great offseason so far","12053":"I think so","12054":"lol We've been there.","12055":"Sounds like a Lion","12056":">you got Wiggins, Aboushi, and Dahl in addition for the line.\n\nWhich is why they need guards","12057":"We dont need a WR we have our starting 3 and a roomie from last year. We\u2019ll get one later but its not a need. A need is someone who can come in and fight for a starting job day 1 like the guards we got.","12058":"lol oh yeah duh I'm an idiot. Was thinking it was only okwara, somehow already forgot okudah","12059":"I never realized you got Trufant. Lions have to be division favourites right now.","12060":"I mean they extended Dahl and Wiggins played well last year. Also didn\u2019t they also sign some dude from the 49ers?","12061":"I mean they extended Dahl and Wiggins played well last year. Also didn\u2019t they also sign some dude from the 49ers?","12062":"You think Stenberg starts this year?","12063":"That's a little lofty, I think the Vikings are the favorites and the rest is kind of hazy. We changed a lot but we had a lot to make up for.","12064":"Id have to imagine he has a very good shot since what we have now isn\u2019t all that great. Of course with covid who knows what disadvantage all rookies will have going in.","12065":"Once again, we want to thank [sportsreference.com](https:\/\/www.sports-reference.com\/), who have provided most of the stats you see today and this weekend.

We needed a backup\/compliment to bell.","12068":"What pick did we run out of original comments?","12069":"Evidently Douglas is real big on Florida. Someone tell me how to feel?","12070":"I kinda wish the Jets keep Bilal Powell around.","12071":"Perine does most things well, but isn't great at anything. He got screwed by having an absolutely horrendous offensive line his senior season after he lost four starters after his third year. He was dynamic against Virginia in the Orange Bowl though, glad he was able to do well in his last game as a Gator!","12072":"Steal, jets are gonna be great","12073":"Tbh I liked Eno Benjamin better but thats me being biased","12074":"As a Florida fan I\u2019m happy. As a Dolphins fan I\u2019m unhappy. I\u2019ll be here all day.","12075":"Really good pickup. This guy can put on a show. Really enjoyed watching him in college.","12076":"Those gunmetal Florida jerseys are nasty","12077":"bElL iN sHAmBels","12078":"LeVeon getting cut next year :(","12079":"Not bad","12080":"Ah good I was hoping we\u2019d land another back","12081":"He was pretty good against us","12082":"Howard the Duck?!? I'm in on this pick!","12083":"Jack of all trades, master of none. Could be a good 3rd down back due to his pass catching abilities or change of pace back for the Jets behind L'Bell","12084":"Sounds like a Madden generated rookie","12085":"Good player. Should complement Bell well.","12086":"Bell needs to be saved by the bell","12087":"Bell in trouble \/s","12088":"Phew","12089":"Bell in shambles.","12090":"Don\u2019t love this pick for the Jets. We had more important needs such as CB.","12091":"Trade Bell to the Dolphins","12092":"This is not a good pick. Also is counter to the strategy Jets had been using on Jets drafting on high athletic scores. Don\u2019t think he was the best RB available. Confusing pick. Other more pressing needs.","12093":"His cousin*\n\nEdit: also related to Myles Jack on Jacksonville","12094":"His alive cousin","12095":"Theyre cousins.","12096":"They\u2019re cousins I believe","12097":"Google tells me that they're cousins.","12098":"Yep and DeVante.","12099":"Possibly his sister, maybe his father","12100":"Cousins","12101":"They are related.

Good hands, good blocker and pretty good vision. Not a ton of carries at UF, was in a 50\/50 committee until this last season","12112":"He\u2019s a great runner. Florida didn\u2019t have a great OLine last year so the run game wasn\u2019t really there but he\u2019s got great hands out of the backfield. Used a lot in the passing game last year. Still had some huge runs. [This being his best. or my favorite at least. ](https:\/\/youtu.be\/PMym6BS8Ei8)","12113":"Florida fan, he\u2019s a good all around back, runs well, catches well, and blocks well for the QB.","12114":"Watched every game he played. Very solid runner. Hard to take down and makes guys miss every way possible. Super nice and humble guy, I\u2019m a big fan of his. I\u2019m surprised he didn\u2019t go in the third.","12115":"Good at everything great at nothing. Us florida fans love him and he has some amazing moments for us. His run to seal the auburn game is probably the loudest the swamp has been in a decade\n\nVery hard worker. Originally from Alabama and no one wanted to give him a shot at a scholarship. He saved up his money and got a bus ticket to travel down to UF for junior day and earned himself a scholarship offer.\n\nHes good for randomly breaking off a big run in games that pretty much ends the other teams hopes and dreams. Our OL was very awful at run blocking this year so we would struggle for 75% of games and then perine would just decide to start breaking off runs.\n\nImo Pierce and Davis are more talented runners than perine and have a higher ceiling but perine was able to do so much that it was hard to justify anyone else being the number 1. Without him pass blocking and staying as trasks checkdown we wouldve been screwed more than a few times.","12116":"Basically a WR in the backfield. Not powerful but a good runner and can catch","12117":"So do we.","12118":"I\u2019m gonna buy his jersey if he gets cut.","12119":"He performs great against SEC competition for one.\n\nAnyone doubting the kid just needs to watch his Auburn(elite defensive line) and LSU(elite defense) tape.  Exceptional ability to not let guys get a clean hit on him somehow SEC defenders are always taking bad angles on him.\n\nReally good receiver out of the backfield, good in pass protection, really good vision, deceptively speedy.","12120":"We are? :')","12121":"We don't have any gunmetal jerseys...?","12122":"Swamp green","12123":"Remove sarcasm","12124":"Nah, this is just to lighten Bell's load and give teh Jets a secondary backfield option.","12125":"Same , but with Kelley","12126":"Lions play the Gators?\n\nDidn't think it had gotten that bad","12127":"There\u2019s a thing called backups","12128":"we have 2 more picks in the next 8","12129":"so you're saying he has a dead one?  ESPN is salivating for this info!","12130":"After watching him in Washington, I think that's disputable","12131":"And they were roommates","12132":"How\u2019s he related to cousins?","12133":"...and therefore, the World.","12134":"No way. He is going to be Sam Darnold's best friend. He is an elite pass blocker. Pretty good at everything else.","12135":"Off-topic, but I love the audio on these types of plays...Starts off quiet because it's a normal play developing. Then as he gets into open space, the crowd goes wild. And they collectively breathe in as they wait to see if he'll break the last tackle...and then go wild again! I'm sure it's not the only play like this but damn it's a cool shot of it.","12136":"Oh I love Perine, I went to Florida. If he was more explosive athletically he'd be a top prospect.

IMO highest ceiling TE in this class and he absolutely balled out with Drew Lock, but numbers fell off last year without Drew.","12222":"broncos were my sleeper team for playoffs before the draft, now theyre having an incredible draft. could b a scary team frfr","12223":"This guy was a beast with Drew Lock (coincidence?). Kinda sucked because Kelly Bryant fell off a massive cliff but he's legit.","12224":"Pro-tip for the Broncos fans from a Mizzou fan. You can set a keyboard shortcut for Albert Okwuegbunam so you can flex on all the people just typing Albert O.\n\n\nAlso, [here is a pronunciation guide](https:\/\/twitter.com\/MizzouFootball\/status\/1254090616977457152)","12225":"Broncos have two speedy TEs now","12226":"I am absolutely lost with where we're at with the picks. I know day 3 runs quicker, but ESPN have not helped.","12227":"This is the Drew Lock draft for Denver","12228":"Do the Broncos still have Fumagalli?","12229":"Great pick up, you assholes!","12230":"Damn they really want Lock to succeed","12231":"Bruh that tight end duo is so fast","12232":"Ofc they go on ads for the falcons pick. SMH","12233":"4.49 at 6'5 and almost 260 is crazy.","12234":"Here's the answer to that guy who made the post last night asking about him. lol.","12235":"How did we end up with this pick?","12236":"##get Lock some help","12237":"Crazy. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine our two TE formations and the havoc it\u2019ll cause. Imagine being a DC in the AFCW right now \ud83d\ude02 sheeeesh. Can the season start already ?","12238":"Trying to outpace the Chiefs.","12239":"Hate to break it to you guys, but we drafted the best TE. The mustache is how I can tell.","12240":"Damn, the Broncos ain\u2019t messing around. Heck of a draft.","12241":"This division is getting faster and faster","12242":"I had Noah Fant and Albert O as my starting TE, each on a different franchise, and they both put up ~1500 yds and 20 something TDs\n\nwhat I'm trying to say is I really like Denver's TE room","12243":"Why did we sign Vannett and Extend Heuerman then?","12244":"Thad Moss should be coming up soon.","12245":"Fuck me that's another good weapon for Lock Denver has to chill","12246":"Albert O RULED for me in Madden","12247":"Oof.  If I were a 4th round pass-catching TE, one of the last places I'd want to be is on the same team as Noah Fant.","12248":"MIZ","12249":"he should have a good talk with his grandma on Wednesday this week","12250":"https:\/\/youtu.be\/ZZuaCma6zns -Elway","12251":"That\u2019s a mouthful of a last name","12252":"QUIT TAKING MIZZOU PLAYERS JOHN!","12253":"TE Kings baby!","12254":"Playoffs baby!!!","12255":"Don't forget... Butt.. Ya I guess that's not happening","12256":"NFL going to have to re-write regulations on font size lol","12257":"Helps when your defense is already pretty loaded.","12258":"really fun, and it fills me with hope for the future.","12259":"It\u2019s pretty neat seeing a front office that actually seems to want to help the franchise QB succeed. I\u2019m a (golden) bears fan and it kills me to see what they\u2019re doing to Aaron right now.","12260":"I'm also a Packers fan and root for a Packers\/Broncos Superbowl every year. \n\nIt's been a tale of two drafts so far...","12261":"It\u2019s nice to not need a QB for once.","12262":"Pretty awesome you guys should try it!","12263":"You cats have been complaining that you want to draft skill position players and Gute drafted you two skill position players.  What more do you want, Jack?","12264":"HAHA you're right, we fast bois!\n\nSutton - 4.54\n\nGordon - 4.52\n\nFant - 4.50\n\nAlbert O - 4.49\n\nJeudy - 4.45\n\nLindsey - 4.39\n\nHamler - 4.27","12265":"Seriously, it matches the Packers needs almost exactly.","12266":"We\u2019ve spent 4 of our first 6 picks essentially boosting our starting QB. Including a top WR, top speedster, top interior lineman, and a good TE prospect. I imagine the Packers would be over the moon if that read off to them.","12267":"Former teammate Albert O. Mile High gonna be turnt this year","12268":"I don\u2019t think you guys are addressing the defense enough tbh.","12269":"I have a lot of friends in Missouri and it was whiplash last year from celebrating the Blues cup with them to absolutely loathing your Super Bowl run haha.","12270":"Hopefully you see one a lot more than the other \ud83d\ude02","12271":"Don\u2019t forget Sam Martin!","12272":"I feel like every Mizzou player that gets drafted is always to the fucking broncos.","12273":"Virgil Green 2.0?","12274":"Yeah that\u2019s how I read this. Heuerman had a good run as guy you think could maybe be good but never really shows up consistently. I think he\u2019s worth a flyer as a back up for other teams, but I think Fant as starter, Vannett as blocking TE, and Now Albert O as backup\/developmental guy is a great unit.","12275":"Empty set with Fant, Albert O, Jeudy, Sutton, and Hamler lined up? Absurd. Hell, put Hamler on the bench with Phil or Gordon out there and Vannett instead of O and we\u2019re still set. I\u2019m EXCITED to see how this offense works.","12276":"He is a stud but this is more so because Josh Heipel stopped putting Albert O in positions to ball out then it is necessarily KBs fault. Seriously so glad the Barry Odom era is finally over","12277":"Damn. Thank you!","12278":"There going to be a nightmare to guard.","12279":"They do their fanfare fluff piece bs for ten minutes then spend three minutes discussing the last seven picks. It sucks, I know there are a lot of players but spread it out a little more and spend time on each one in more detail.","12280":"We have 8 TEs:\n\nFant, Vannett, Okuegbunam, Andrew Beck, Jeff Heuerman, Jake Butt, Fumagalli, Austin Fort","12281":"And Butt, Heuerman, Venett etc. we now have almost as many TEs as the Bears.","12282":"Yeah, for now. It's a crowded room though.","12283":"I believe he\u2019s still on the roster but he\u2019s never really cracked the starting roster. He\u2019s still cheap so I think Jeff Heuerman will be the one getting the axe with this pick. Noah Fant \/ Jake Butt \/ Fumagalli with this guy should be a very solid room.","12284":"Yes, our TE room was already over capacity. Lots of guys with injury histories though","12285":"Yes","12286":"Yeah, but he is probably going to cut after this. This makes like 6 TEs on the roster.","12287":"Don't you?","12288":" they're already about 2 picks behind in the coverage.","12289":"This one is ours. The 137 pick was from SF.","12290":"You joke, but Dalton Keene is a beast. Yall got a stud.","12291":"Yeah but 40 time tells me Broncos got the best one.","12292":"They're going to cut Heuerman, and he was not extended this year.  That was the previous.","12293":"Running the first ever 9 TE set","12294":"Vannett is more of a blocking tight end. We might let Heuerman go as well with funagali.","12295":"Vannett will probably block more, Hueurman imo will be cut to save cap.","12296":"Heuerman didn't get extended this season, Vannett got traded to play his role for cheaper.","12297":"Cowboys pls, fuck defense","12298":"Unless the QB is your buddy who you have more experience with.","12299":"Not a concern with Shurmer calling plays. Fant can lineup anywhere, plus Albert O gets to play with his boy Drew Lock again","12300":"As an 8th generation Coloradan and 3rd generation season ticket holder all the fellow Mizzou alum rolling in here makes me so happy.","12301":"And Heuerman, and Fumagalli, and Vannett","12302":"I will never get over the fact that Kittle was available when we took Butt.","12303":"And you got the best OL coach in the league and a fairly well invested in OL\n\nStill won't prevent the people who think our OL was bad last season from nay saying","12304":"Yeah we\u2019re in a pretty good situation where our starters on defense are all pretty much set. Not only were we solid on D last year but we\u2019re getting two pieces back that theoretically would make us even more complete in Chubb and Callahan. Our offense has been abysmal for 5 years. This is clearly the year we\u2019re serious about fixing that.","12305":"Roll on!","12306":"Afc west: who can run to the endzone first","12307":"I fucking like this","12308":"I don\u2019t think that self-reported Hamler time counts, no way he\u2019s as fast as Ruggs. He is fast as fuck though.","12309":"Traded for AJ Bouye and Jurrell Casey.  Also brought back Justin Simmons, Shelby Harris, and Mike Purcell.  We will also get Bryce Callahan and Bradley Chubb back this year. The defense has already been addressed.  We will probably sign a veteran corner before TC.","12310":"AFC West besides the Chargers say fuck defense","12311":"Our entire FA was spent on the defense.  We addressed our biggest need at CB at 19.  Some people seem to forget our defense was ranked 24th.  Our offense?  Also 24th.  Our offense needs help, too.","12312":"I really wanted a coverage LB there. We haven't addressed that hole in our defense for years.","12313":"I feel more tackle. We are set at safety and okay up front do need more depth in other areas but not getting a tackle to replace Bolles seems dumb especially since we could have had Josh Jones in the second.","12314":"I was mad about both, so that's neat","12315":"AO is from Illinois","12316":"Lmao, watch Sammy blast some beauties though!","12317":"Yeah, he's the Martin in my comment haha. I did forget that they also signed Driskel though","12318":"We have more playmakers than we can fit on the field.","12319":"You mean Derek Dooley. Heupel was gone after Alberts breakout year.","12320":"Especially in madden","12321":"You guys *really* like B1G TEs","12322":"Bug Howard","12323":"Butt and Fumagalli definitely aren't safe, they're not keeping 5 TEs.\n\nFant, this guy, and Vannett are the only guys safe right now","12324":"So did you, Albert is the shit and Jeudy?? Just unfair","12325":"40 time matters about as much as which family members of theirs died prior to the draft","12326":"Oh right sorry, I thought that was this offseason","12327":"It doesn't matter.  He's *maybe* half the weapon that Fant is.  He won't see more than a handful of snaps unless Fant gets hurt.\n\nPeople say that \"but they were great together in college\" thing all the time, but it almost always ends up meaning nothing in the NFL.","12328":"Don't forget training camp darling Austin Fort","12329":"Just two picks later. Also don\u2019t trouble yourself by looking at us taking Cody latimer before Jarvis Landry, or russel Wilson  being available when we drafted brock.","12330":"Wasn't Butt targeted to be a much higher pick, but fell due to injury? It was a high risk high reward, and boy has those injuries kept coming.","12331":"Munchak \ud83d\ude22","12332":"Our man Boles better figure his holding out","12333":"First one to defense wins","12334":"Yeah, same. Lol, even if he's 4.35 speed that receiver room is FAST","12335":"Only thing I can find is sub 4.3","12336":"He easily can run in the in the 4.2\u2019s. Hell, he ran a 4.43 with a pulled hammy.","12337":"Damn, I didn't realize you guys brought back Shelby Harris. Definitely wanted him on the Lions.","12338":"I expect us to sign Prince inside the next few days","12339":"What's the latest on Callahan these days? Foot fully healed?","12340":"Plus, we have Vic Fangio as our HC. It\u2019s such a luxury to have a coach who can turn end of the bench players like Alexander Johnson and Mike Purcell to really good starters. Bausby was also playing well before he went down.","12341":"Also brought back role players like Bausby, attatchou, Malik Reed, Trey Marshall.","12342":"I feel like he was maybe referring to the Raiders not addressing defense?","12343":"Our defense was already really good tho. We added Jurrell fucking Casey this offseason.","12344":"Defense is for nerds","12345":"Our D was good last year and that was with Chubb missing","12346":"Our defense played remarkably well for a whole new scheme, coordinator and players. Already drafted a good looking LB and I would think we go with a CB next pick.","12347":"Chargers legitimately have a top 5 defense it\u2019s crazy.","12348":"We\u2019re going to continue to get burned by TEs","12349":"Southern Illinois. Illinois is divided into two maybe 3 sections of St.Louis, Chicago and then some Davenport weirdos","12350":"Yes. That's exactly what I meant.","12351":"I don't know if even Vannett is actually safe.  It's a short contract so we could take a hit.  Granted who knows which of our TEs end up on IR this year","12352":"How'd it work last year when all your recievers except Dorsett were running 4.5-4.6? And with Nkeal Harry over Metcalf?","12353":"Two TE sets. And Albert O is a better red zone target. Fant will get the yards and receptions. Albert O will catch the TDS.","12354":"Yeah I still think about that at 2am in bed some nights. Imagine Russ as Peyton's successor instead of Brock... Heck, the Hawks probably never make it to the Superbowl so we lose that trauma too","12355":"That\u2019s us, homie. We\u2019re a top 7 defense in the league with Chubb coming back healthy and exchanging a CHJ who\u2019s slowing down for Bouye and Jerrell Casey for an older Derek Wolfe.","12356":"It\u2019s just a 1 year deal.","12357":"We don't know lol. Hopefully","12358":"Johnson wasn't end of the bench talent, he would've been highly drafted without his legal issue.","12359":"Malik Reed is like a baby Shaq Barrett","12360":"Attatchou was great for us considering we picked him up off the street last year. It amazes me that guys with good track records just sit around like that when pass rush is so important in the NFL","12361":"Yeah I don't see what's wrong with loading up the O this year. Defense is much the same as last year.","12362":"Why did you remind me \ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2d","12363":"And AJ Bouye","12364":"We're also adding back who would have been our best player on defense last season","12365":"So do the Broncos","12366":"I know?","12367":"He's the only TE on the roster tho with some blocking ability","12368":"It didn't work at all, but Dorsett was open way less than the slower guys were lol. 40 time doesn't mean shit, just ask John Ross. It's all about technique.","12369":"I\u2019m with you, although living in Nashville and annually attending camp\/game with my Titans fan daughter, I\u2019d have to point out that Jurrell is older and just slowed down a bit this past year.","12370":"All we need.","12371":"Shockingly affordable too","12372":"Was sad to see him go, but that injury history has been rough. If he is healthy, I know Fangio can get the most out of him. Talent\/effort is top 10 in the league at NCB.","12373":"The talent was there, but he was cut a couple of times and bounced around until Vic utilized him well.","12374":"Yeah, Reed is good, I can see the similarities. He'll be starting somewhere in a couple years I'm sure","12375":"With Chubb coming back! Let's get it!","12376":"Miller, Chubb, Casey, Johnson, Bouye, Callahan (Who?), S. Miller, Simmons, KJax, and lots of depth. Our defense will be fine. Especially since we addressed a DT and CB in the draft.","12377":"Are Beck and Fort not on the roster?","12378":"John Ross was balling out until he got injured. Hell even the classic athletic freak bust with Perriman started balling out once he was the #1 target in Tampa Bay. And in the draft you want upside and a lot of the time 40 time gives you higher upside. Once you develop your skills it becomes a lot easier to get open if you're really fast. Sure sometimes it never works out but it gives you a much better chance of becoming a good player.\n\nAnd Dorsett is still a decent WR 3\/4 purely cause of his speed. If he ran a 4.5 or 4.6 he'd straight up be out of the league.","12379":"I don\u2019t need him to be as fast as he was, just maintain the same acceleration and push and give Von the ability to take the edge.","12380":"Like cheaper than Wolfe affordable lol","12381":"Agreed. Here's hoping!","12382":"Lol no he didn't. Elway signed him as an udfa immediately after his chargers were dismissed, and there were several teams heavily pursuing him. If he wasn't falsely accused of rape in college he would've been at least a 2nd round pick. He didn't play football for around two years, that's the reason he wasn't playing immediately.","12383":"John Ross' career catch rate is 42%. He's literally caught less than half of the balls thrown to him. \n\nI'd rather have a receiver with hands than a receiver with the fastest legs, but thanks.","12384":"[I specifically remember the Broncos cutting him and almost going to Miami, here\u2019s the article](https:\/\/www.google.com\/amp\/s\/www.9news.com\/amp\/article\/sports\/nfl\/denver-broncos\/mike-klis\/cut-and-nearly-heading-to-miami-last-year-alexander-johnson-rewarding-broncos-faith\/73-751b22ab-e1d6-4f34-bd27-7e247325ee5d)\n\nEdit: My bad, thought another team scooped him up before us. He was only cut 1 time but stayed in the PS, and he didn\u2019t bounce around I stand corrected","12385":"And I'd rather a receiver with bad hands that actually gets open and stretches the defense than one that has good hands but is slow and never gets open and demands zero safety help.","12386":"Okay, go ask the Eagles how that worked out with Nelson Agholor.","12387":"He's not even crazy fast but ok. Now ask New England how Harry over Metcalf was working? \n\nLet's say we get to choose one good receiver and one average one and a bad one. I'd take Metcalf, Fuller, and Ross over Edelman, Sanu, and Harry. Speed and separation with questionable hands > good hands but no separation and never scaring the defense deep.","12388":">Now ask New England how Harry over Metcalf was working?\n\nIt's working pretty well. Despite being injured for the first 8 weeks, he quickly showed a lot of talent in the games he did play. He was a dominant runner, caught nearly everything thrown his way, and steamrolled the Chiefs defense for what should have been ruled a touchdown. I like the pick.\n\nAlso, the fact that you'd take speed and questionable hands over less speed and sure hands for a position that requires having sure hands for success? Shows how little you know about football.","12389":"Your lying to yourself if you say you'd want Nkeal Harry over Metcalf. Dude had like two good plays all season and was a no show in the playoffs while Metcalf had 900 yards and 150 in the playoffs.","12390":"You're lying to yourself, says the one grading prospects based on height and 40 time. Delusional lmfao","12391":"Hey it worked for Metcalf over Harry. And that comment like yours was a joke.","12392":"There's our late round DE that Zimmer will somehow turn into a Pro Bowler","12393":"Better pick than DJ Losenum","12394":"good name good pick is my logic","12395":"Fuck we took the furry","12396":"Anyone got any insight on this guy?","12397":"WONnum","12398":"I don't know anything about him, but he's got the stage name of an especially bad mumble rapper","12399":"I trust zimmer and Patterson to pick DEs. If they like this guy that's good enough for me","12400":"SC fans, how are we supposed to feel?","12401":"Weaver still there.","12402":"Can\u2019t spell won without Wonnum","12403":"this is not good","12404":"Counterpoint: Scott Crichton","12405":"You mean Andre Patterson","12406":"The late round pick threads are my favourite time of year on this sub lmao","12407":"You Wonnum, you Losenum.","12408":"UwU","12409":"I\u2019m a South Carolina fan. High motor guy. A bit inconsistent. He would look dominate for a few drives a game. Caused pressure but would just miss out on sacks. Solid value in the 4th.","12410":"His otherkin is a rabbit","12411":"His parents both died in a tragic tandem skydiving accident in 2016","12412":"His tape showed he played for SC","12413":"The 4-7th rounds are a bit of a crapshoot, but this is a kid I was really hoping we would find a way to get. I originally thought we could sneak him in the 6th or 7th and get probably one of the biggest steals of the draft, but he started climbing pretty hard the last week or two. By today it didn't matter to me where we got him, as long as we got him on our roster.","12414":"Went to HS with him, such a great guy and great athlete","12415":"He's a little injury prone, but when he is out on the field, he has the potential to be super disruptive. Seems to play better when he's a supporting guy. Like at Carolina, he was a pretty solid #2 to #1 Kinlaw. The talent is there, and I think with development, he can be a starter.","12416":"Easter is his favorite holiday","12417":"I remember seeing him when they played Bama, Georgia, and Florida, seemed decent, got into the backfield a couple times.","12418":"Yeah I don\u2019t wonnum. That\u2019s my insight","12419":"Lonely and depressed, waiting on death. Oh you mean about the pick. Uhh he\u2019s pretty good","12420":"Muschamp held our players back more than their talent did. He should be alright","12421":"Gamecock fan here. Whelmed. I thought he would be picked up as a UDFA","12422":"Has great potential but wasn't the kind of dominant force you'd expect with Kinlaw on the same DLine. Had a big sophomore year where he led the SEC in TFL.","12423":"Crichton was too polished to be developed, for Zim to develop a DE he has to have no more than 15 total sacks in college","12424":"Bof","12425":"Know when to foldnum","12426":"Danielle Hunter had 1.5 sacks his senior year and 4 his entire college career. This is a perfect Vikings fit.","12427":"wtf does that even mean","12428":"You know what rabbits do best? Fuck. So by transitive property, this guy fucks.","12429":"lol","12430":"Are you ok?","12431":"Gamecocks and Browns fan? I may know you. There can\u2019t be that many people who overlap those.","12432":"Damn, dude. Gamecock fan AND Browns fan? That\u2019s some commitment.","12433":"Thanks for the input!","12434":"So we used a fourth on a guy we could have gotten in fa. Of course Rick.","12435":"That's...not true. In '17 he had 13.0 tfls which was tied for 8th. Montez Sweat outta Mississippi State led the conference with 16.0\n\nBut I agree with your point about being on the same line with Kinlaw. He should have made more opportunities for himself.","12436":"Wonnum has 22","12437":"Zimmer is a great coach for him. If he can become more consistent, he will be a fantastic pickup. I think solid rotational pass rusher is his floor.","12438":"Danielle is unique tho bro","12439":"Think fury but they think they are that animal trapped in a humans body","12440":"A rabbit is kind of like a bunny","12441":"I think it means he's a furry","12442":"No one knows what it means, but it's provocative","12443":"When you're Bugs Bunny and your primary rival is a Monstar, things get pretty dark","12444":"He is likely better than I am giving him credit for. Last year bummed me out. I thought Kinlaw was a third round pick, but people who know more than me picked him for the 1st.","12445":"Ahh shit. Ok my bad","12446":"Uhh, he had 14?","12447":"Plus he was like 15 when we drafted him.","12448":"Oh for sure. But when people ask why he fell so low, it's largely due to his production. Leave of college production for a DL prospect won't scare the Vikings off.","12449":"Why did we just draft a furry","12450":"You thought Kinlaw was a third? He had the first locked down a year and a half ago, it was just a matter of how high he could climb.","12451":"I think he might be talking about Lynch","12452":"...is there a source or is this a meme?","12453":"Why not?","12454":"I am not a good judge of such things. When I think first round I think Clowney, and to me Kinlaw isn't half of what Clowney was. That's why I am keeping my day job.","12455":"Yup, my mistake :(","12456":"You know he means business when his name is on his helmet","12457":"\u201cFine heres your stupid OL\u201d Dave caldwell to jags fans","12458":"ESPN has gone to commercial on 5 out of 5 Jags picks","12459":"Damn, a Johnnie. Congrats","12460":"I\u2019d barf the second I sipped his smoothie.","12461":"Happy for the kid","12462":"ESPN too busy talking to Danny Dimes","12463":"Day 3 doesn't give a shit about ad breaks so hence ESPN falling behind.","12464":"How fucking cool for him! College is just down the road from me.","12465":"That smoothie sounds disgusting","12466":"ESPN is pretty behind lol","12467":"Damn one before us.","12468":"My back has been really tight these past few days. Just stretched for like a half hour and spent some time on the foam roller and I\u2019m like 50% sure I experienced a life changing event.

MN pride!","12475":"Big Fella, need more details","12476":"YO this dude is the first player from St. Johns's in MN to go pro in like 50 years! Go Johnnies!","12477":"Nasty shake guy!","12478":"First glance I thought we traded back in.","12479":"Has anyone here ever watched him? How should I feel?","12480":"Great pick","12481":"Damn I wanted him","12482":"He\u2019s about to turn Duuuvall into St. Johns County","12483":"I\u2019d never drink a protein shake with Gatorade but more power to this kid.","12484":"Ben \"protein guzzler\" Bartch","12485":"The smoothie king!!","12486":"He better watch out because Anthony McFarland jr will slap that cup out of his hands.","12487":"Just popping in to say fuck this POS. Sorry Jags fans but I hope he doesn't make it. He loves using slurs and I've heard him saying terrible things about Mexicans and Somalians.","12488":"He might Garrett you if you take his helmet.","12489":"Its an exceptionally strong OL name, Bartch.  Expect him to get the bag on the second deal.","12490":"Ar this point I want Dave to intentionally trade to a spot immediately after commercial just to see ESPN go back to commercial","12491":"Ive been noticing that too, it just feels intentional","12492":"We could draft Trevor Lawrence at 1 next year and they'd go to commercial.","12493":"It's to allow us to get a drink. Think of it as a courtesy.","12494":"As is tradition","12495":"He ain\u2019t afraid to play St Thomas!","12496":"I\u2019m sad he didn\u2019t go to the Vikings. But at least he didn\u2019t go to GB.","12497":"Seriously.  \n\nAlso, it ended up working and he was drafted, but man, I would so advise against a D3 guy purposefully adding 60 pounds just for football lol","12498":"Gatorade? It doesn\u2019t really do much tbh.","12499":"Drinking a cup of orange juice is easier than eating 5 oranges, you know","12500":"He's a converted tight end. Great athlete. I work with someone who goes to the combine and this was a guy he talked about right after.\n\nAlso he drinks some kind of disgusting smoothie everyday.","12501":"He\u2019s ok\n\nObvious concerns about the level of competition, but his footwork is really solid. Kick step is strong. I just saw him get beat a lot on spin moves and not know what angle to take in run blocking\n\nFor day 3, though... it\u2019s an ok pick. Not my favorite, though. Wanted to go HB, or if we were going OT, take Pinter or Herron","12502":"Ben \u201cThe Smoothie King\u201d Bartch","12503":"If it makes you feel better even if he doesn't make it he's a millionaire \ud83d\ude1c","12504":"Its every year. Its intentional.","12505":"Is the Gatorade meant to mask the taste or something? I don't see that working well enough.","12506":"I went to his college, we're the same age so i went to school and watched him play all 4 years. It's even better when you phrase it this way:\n\nFreshman year was 3rd string TE. Coaches told him he wouldn't play unless he switched positions.Barely played at all freshman and sopho\nmore year .\nbetween sophomore and senior year he learned to play LT and he was putting on weight as fast as he could. By the end of his Jr season he was a force, and going into his senior season people knew he was going to dominate D3 as a LT. \n\n\nIn just 2\/3 seasons he went from your standard D3 Tight end to a legit NFL prospect as a LT who was holding his own against top D1 talent in the senior bowl\n\n I will go on record saying he could easily be the steal of the draft, his potential is sky high and he could change a franchise if he keeps developing","12507":"Thanks for the insight friend!","12508":">For day 3, though... it\u2019s an ok pick. \n\nyou guys should absolutely love this pick. He has the potential to be the steal of the draft","12509":"I prefer protein guzzlers","12510":"its all done for calories. I know Ben. He would have put lead in that shit if it was safe and provided calories","12511":"Yeah, the guy from the combine was gushing over a d3 kid, so I figured he is legit. He said he moves like someone 50lbs lighter.","12512":"when r\/nfl is more reliable than espn and nfl network","12513":"he's not in the SEC","12514":"ESPN y\u2019all trash today.","12515":"this one feels really good, we needed someone who can show up as a blocker in the TE position. Njoku's days here might be numbered, which sounds like a great comp pick","12516":"Big boi to challenge Njoku.  I'm good with it.\n\nUnanimous All American, kinda like Delpit was.  Interesting pattern, Berry. \n\nEdit:  Also the John Mackey award winner of 2019, which is cool.","12517":"I guess fuck announcing them. \n\nI just swapped to local radio because at least they discuss the picks.","12518":"Memes and bullshit aside I actually think he has a chance to be the best TE in the class.","12519":"Interesting, wonder if we move on from Njoku","12520":"Very good value","12521":"Huh.","12522":"YALL GOT A DOG IN HARRY B THIS IS A GREAT PICK","12523":"Yes I love it!  He was my favorite TE in the draft and I think he\u2019ll take Njoku\u2019s spot by start of the season","12524":"Still heated the Browns got my Jordan Elliot.","12525":"This just further affirms the Browns are going to be running two tight end sets.","12526":"Njoku has gotta he on the move.","12527":"I have no idea who this guy is","12528":"I\u2019m for that. Need a solid backup to Hooper, since Njoku can only do so much","12529":"He was great to watch at FAU. Shocked the Browns took him though since they have Hooper and Njoku.","12530":"RIP Kobe","12531":"Did Albert O murder someone while wearing a Kaep jersey?","12532":"Why are teams stocking up on so many TEs. New trend? Good get but damn they don't need him with Hooper and Njoku already","12533":"Did the Browns not know LSU TE Thad Moss was available?","12534":"A lot of people seem to be forgetting that Cleveland signed Austin Hooper, this is almost certainly the writing on the wall for Njoku. Watched this kid ball out, he's really good at just about everything you can ask a TE to do.","12535":"Did you guys know the Barkley supports his brother?","12536":"The status quo for like the last decade.","12537":"Yeah he is he just got drafted by LSU. Read the post","12538":"ESPN y\u2019all trash ~~today.~~","12539":"Espn is trash every day","12540":"They\u2019ve talked about like three picks and said \u201cfuck you\u201d to everyone else","12541":"So sick of trey wingo","12542":"Yeah I'm cool with this. Not having TE depth was shitty last season","12543":"Hes going to be more of a pass catcher I think.","12544":"He's a willing blocker, but it's definitely not a strength of his especially being a tad light.  Looks like he could improve with coaching though since he seems comfortable blocking just needs to get better at it","12545":"Njoku's days \"might\" be numbered? His days have been numbered since the day we signed Hooper.","12546":"I think it\u2019s more like \u201cbig boi to make Njoku expendable\u201d personally.","12547":"FAU fan here. Can confirm. Will make a great weapon for Baker with a chip on his shoulder. Browns may have gotten the steal of the draft.","12548":"Same here. I was hoping he would be there at 120, especially since there's now 125 and 129.","12549":"I prefer Bryant","12550":"He is definitely better than any TE in the class he produced unlike the other picks and the dude is a beast when he gets rolling","12551":"That won't exactly be a difficult feat.","12552":"Nah I doubt it. We needed a 3rd guy, especially in this new offense","12553":"Probably not. It's good to have a couple solid Tight Ends. I mean look at the bears, they have 10...","12554":"What happened to Njoku? I thought he stopped dropping passes? Has he just been hurt?","12555":"We're Minnesota East.  Stephanski coaching, drafting all the boys who wore purple and yellow, etc etc.","12556":"I want two tight ends with Chubb and Hunt in.","12557":"This is his last year to truly prove himself or move on.","12558":"He also was named best Tight End in the country last year. Saw him play in college a lot, y\u2019all got a good one.","12559":"We've entered the rounds where 90% of people are frantically googling who the hell the picks are","12560":"He\u2019s a tight end","12561":"you will soon enough buddy","12562":"Njokus gone after this season probably. Still hasnt improved his blocking, injury prone and stone hands. We needed another good blocking TE.","12563":"Did you know He won the award for best tight end in the nation?","12564":"Geaux Breauxns","12565":"Hey, I love ESPN. They\u2019re the most reliable source for dead relatives","12566":"Tbf these picks go by really really quickly","12567":"If you like watching one man abuse another man Trey Wingo broadcasting is the guy for you","12568":"Njoku doesn't seem to enjoy doing that consistently so I am on board with that lol","12569":"he has good blocking technique though. dude's a good blocker even though he's a little undersized for a blocking tight end","12570":"We have room for more than one tight end on the roster. Njoku\u2019s still on a rookie contract. No reason to cut or trade him right now, but if he had a nice season this year we might resign him, just not for very much now that we have Hooper.","12571":"Yep. Unless Chief shows up in a big way he's off for a compensatory pick next year.","12572":"I can see us moving him after this year though","12573":"Cleveland resigned Pharaoh Brown the other day who, IMO, can drop passes just as effectively as Njoku but is a more willing and much more capable blocker. \n\nIt\u2019s either Njoku\u2019s last year or they\u2019re going to explore trading him, either way his future isn\u2019t bright.","12574":"He can\u2019t catch. Can\u2019t block. He\u2019s just athletic. We needed an upgrade and Hooper\/Bryant are just that. Super stoked","12575":"He\u2019s got everything to be great and he looks like he should be a beast but he sucks at the simple things.","12576":"He looks the part of a great TE and he's an athletic freak for the position, but he just can't play the game of football. David Njoku is a retrieving TE, not a receiving TE.","12577":"People here are mostly right about him. Great physical specimen but he's had problems with stone hands in the past. To be fair, last year he did suffer a bad injury trying to catch a hospital ball.","12578":"He was raw coming out then hurt last season.\n\nNjoku is a very good run blocker (sucks at pass blocking) and has been an explosive receiver for a TE. He has a low catch percentage and was very raw coming out of college and missed most of last season with injuries. \n\nVery excited to see what he can do this season. But, the possibility of him being an Ebron type of TE is very much on the table still.","12579":"It\u2019s a good move since you don\u2019t have a third good WR.  Still not scared of you guys though.","12580":"And I get downvoted for being honest.  Ah well.  Go Browns.","12581":"Possibly from Florida Atlantic","12582":"Thanks, Magic.","12583":"He has called damn near every single selection \u201cfaaaascinating\u201d or \u201cinteresting\u201d","12584":"I like Njoku and think he's got a lot of potential, but he needs to show up this year and put in work.","12585":"Yeah I'm sure with some offseason work in the s&c program he'll beef up a bit","12586":"Damn, that sucks. At least you guys got Hooper, he's a fucking stud and it took way too long for everyone to realize that.","12587":".. ok?","12588":"Coulda just left that second sentence out and actually had a productive comment.","12589":"Can confirm.","12590":"This reminds me of what I said about Ebron each season, lol","12591":"Guy above is chatting shit. Missed last year with I jury, had a few high profile drops, but his catch rate is good.\n\nHe'll surprise folk this year","12592":"I mean, I think if Njoku doesmt show up this year we'll cut or trade him.","12593":"Njoku is like an unproven Ebron which is basically enough to be cut from the team if he doesn't show up next year.","12594":"He's not a lost cause by any means but Njoku definitely needs to step up to keep his spot this season","12595":"Which is exactly what we did with Ebron. I just remember Njoku's draft and thinking he was going to be a similar type of player, tons of potential but not consistent enough.","12596":"For sure, he needs to prove himself. He'd shown promising signs in year 2, last year was a write off.\n\nI think we'll see a resurgence","12597":"Yeah im agreeing with you lol","12598":"I'm cautiously optimistic as well but it's nice knowing we're covered in either eventuality","12599":"Sorry, didn't think you were disagreeing. I had hoped the Njoku could put it together more than Ebron did (at least in Detroit; he did have a good season as a red zone weapon when Luck was feeding him), and I was excited to see what he could do with Baker.","12600":"Lmao they really said fuck announcing the picks","12601":"ESPN just rolling commercials instead of picks now?","12602":"One of my favorites. \n\nGj Crads\n\nYou got a lane clogger","12603":"Yet another good Cardinals pick, they are killing it this offseason","12604":"Alot of Utah guys this year it looks like.","12605":"I love these facts so much","12606":"How should I feel?","12607":"ESPN draggin","12608":"thas a big boy\n\n&#x200B;\n\ngreat pick yet again, sober keim is undefeated","12609":"ESPN is trash","12610":"I hate ESPN.  I want highlight or something instead they have to rush through it because they\u2019ve missed like 3 picks due to commercials","12611":"Imagine getting drafted into the NFL then ESPN runs an ad as soon as your name comes on screen","12612":"My name is Glen","12613":"I\u2019m so glad we can see the same commercial instead of players getting drafted in the 4th round!","12614":"I like this true fact to be fair.....","12615":"Take my Fotu","12616":"I love these True Facts lol","12617":"So he's boys with Saahdiq Charles?","12618":"Family full of absolute units","12619":"That's a great pick. I really wanted him at the end of the 4th if he lasted.","12620":"Instead of these \"true facts\" why not put some scouting notes in??","12621":"Good pick. Bit of a beast","12622":"By a round of applause, how should I feel?","12623":"Go Utes.","12624":"Fuck it mode engaged!","12625":"Spanish ESPN rolled with \"Leki Tofu\"","12626":"People are tuning in to see how much the new Ford and Chevy trucks costs nobody wants to see who\u2019s getting picked or any highlights","12627":"Pretty sure they do this every year starting on day 3","12628":"Got to pay the bills man. A rolling ticker during commercials would be nice tho lol","12629":"ABC bro.","12630":"crads ris up","12631":"Crads","12632":"HE CHONK","12633":"with so many teams killing it makes you feel good doesn't it","12634":"Yep and I don't like it","12635":"This makes 5 and there is another in Mel's top 3 right now.","12636":"He\u2019s a beast.","12637":"Heard plenty of media guys talking him up for being nasty and wanting to play football. So you got a guy who wants to be there and will put in 110 percent.","12638":"I had looked into Fotu a little bit before the draft as some mocks had the Pats taking him. He's a classic run-stuffing dt. Gonna take up blockers but probably not get many sacks. Grew up playing rugby (US National team player) and is still relatively new to football.","12639":"Fattest dlineman in the draft. True run stuffing nose.","12640":"He\u2019s a DT which is the position we needed. I\u2019ll have to watch some highlights of him","12641":"Big body. Can stuff the run. Has a problem staying low at times.","12642":"He\u2019s a monster. One of my favorite Utes of recent memory","12643":"My name Jeff","12644":"I can't be the only one that finds those annoying right?","12645":"Shaquem Griffin round of applause.","12646":"ABC is owned by ESPN who's owned by Disney. One in the same","12647":"chip chip","12648":"The Seahawks have had a pretty good draft so far though","12649":"Kicking a fanbase while they\u2019re down >>>>","12650":"My only hope and this is the minuscule thread of hope that I'm clinging to rn is that our plan is to become a power running team who bulldoze the smaller defenders that the nfl has turned to. That's just about the only thing keeping me going.","12651":"Could be worse","12652":"I\u2019m sold","12653":"Pac 12 squad remembers","12654":"Corey Peters\u2019s heir apparent","12655":"That's Jef\u00e9","12656":"yeah I know I was specifically talking about the Packers (one of my real good buddies is a Packers fan and hes' beside himself right now)","12657":"Two time all 1st team, definitely helps against the run","12658":"As a Ute fan I have mixed feelings about this. \n\nThis pick is very much a \u2018hey fuck you Niners\u2019 pick. Dude is a *problem* in the run game.","12659":"Yeah the packers have had the worst draft so far easily. At least the eagles got their position of need in the first","12660":"> definitely helps against the run\n\nShit, that's all you had to say","12661":"But does he help against tightends?","12662":"Yeah like \"oh you just got Trent Williams?\" Kind if deal. Can study under Phillips and be rotated in.","12663":"We got Simmons for that","12664":"More like \u2018oh I heard y\u2019all like to run the ball, eh?\u2019 \n\nFotu is an inside guy, not somebody who\u2019s gonna get many sacks. Huge dude. Strong. Eats up blocks and frees linebackers to attack.","12665":"Fair point. Grop, Wilson, and Goff would think twice about running in the middle. The RBs too obviously, but Simmons, Chan, Fotu, Phillips.... looks like the run game would be tough.","12666":"4 minutes? Come on now pick it up boys","12667":"How should I feel?","12668":"Love what the Panthers are doing. Beefing up that defense.","12669":"This dude is a baller. Good pick","12670":"Guys should I touch my pp over this pick or no","12671":"I\u2019m sorry if this has been talked about I haven\u2019t been watching live but what the fuck is up with these fun facts? Is someone just making random shit up to write there? Why is every player saying the same type of goofy ridiculous thing?","12672":"He\u2019s from Greer, SC! About 1.5 hrs away from Charlotte. Exciting!","12673":"He\u2019s another Rhule pick, raw talent over production.\n\nRivera preferred instead guys like Worley and Elder who had poor 40s but were seen as more \u00ab\u00a0game ready \u00bb\n\nI prefer trusting the coaching and believing in the talent.","12674":"Pride Jr. is going to look really good on a Panthers jersey.","12675":"Shit","12676":"Sad Irish noises!","12677":"It's clear that we're trying to rebuild our woeful defense from last year and I'm happy how we're going about it. I would've liked simmons but the first things we wanted to do was address the line and we got a simmons type of hybrid guy in Chinn. Overall on paper I'm loving this draft.","12678":"How did this kid not play at USC?","12679":"Perfect pick here, he\u2019s going to be a good one. Fast as all get out, decent size, willing tackler and good hands for a DB even if he\u2019s not great at tracking","12680":"He fast","12681":"Dude Panthers defense is gonna be repulsive","12682":"He\u2019s good in my madden franchise \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f","12683":"Hey, I have now officially played football against an NFL player.","12684":"So he's from Greer, SC. I'm not all that high on him, but we'll let our coaches get a crack at him and see how he does.","12685":"Really surprised Rhule didn't take James Lynch here.","12686":"Solid player.","12687":"How is Curtis Weaver still there?","12688":"That woman looked like an old sex doll wtff","12689":"The Panthers got all that time to announce picks and the Cardinals and Browns picked in the span of a commercial break and didn\u2019t even get acknowledged.","12690":"Really damn good, he's a great value. Great athlete","12691":"ND fan here. He\u2019s a great guy with a good attitude and makes plays all over the field. Great technique just had some inconsistencies which led to him getting burned, but with good coaching he can def contribute.","12692":"Pride probably.","12693":"With your hands, if you try using your feet it won\u2019t work much","12694":"Was always considered a late 3rd early 4th guy. Value matches the draft position, and given the state of your secondary he probably can challenge to see the field right away.","12695":"High ceiling and great cover skills. Not a turnover machine but sound in technique. Solid pick","12696":"Aroused","12697":"Whelmed","12698":"Pretty good. I was hoping we'd trade up with y'all for pride or hall","12699":"Filled with Pride.","12700":"Pride was pretty solid at ND","12701":"Good. He\u2019s an NFL cornerback.","12702":"Tons of speed, can def keep up with anybody in the league on that.\n\nBut his ball tracking is below  average so He misses some east plays \n\nAnd he gets a bit to aggressive and can get burned over the top,\n\n\nHas all the talent for the position but has to overcome some mental hurdles","12703":"his gonna beat out jackson.","12704":"Yea our O is good for now, we made some signings\/trades to push the envelope down a couple years, so it was pretty predictable that we were gonna beef up the D this year. Now we can let these raw prospects get their legs under them and gel as a unit and hopefully by the time they're a great unit we will be done revamping the offence.","12705":"It\u2019s the weekend you don\u2019t need an excuse","12706":"nos? Yneo?","12707":"Yeah I'm pretty sure the guy who's making the cards is just making them up","12708":"\/r\/NFL has been doing this for the past several years, if my memory serves. I actually dig it","12709":"Went to Greer! Went to riverside with him his freshman year then he transferred. So pumped for him.","12710":"Also, bluntly, players didn't really progress under Rivera. What you saw at the combine was 90% of what you got.","12711":"I think that\u2019s a very good plan to have with a guy like Troy.\n\nHe played CB2 for us last year when Julian Love was still on the team and he switched to CB1 for us this year pretty seamlessly.\n\nHandling WR2s last year his technique defects could be covered up by him being very fast. This year he\u2019s been asked to handle more and struggled when having to play press coverage on the outside. He\u2019s just not very strong and has shorter arms.\n\nHOWEVER, if he can be coached to grab less downfield and improve in press coverage, he has the elite agility to be a stud nickel CB.\n\nEdit: I was trying to think of who I would compare Troy to. I\u2019d say he\u2019s like Adoree\u2019 Jackson was when he was drafted.","12712":"It's scary to trust a new coach but i am also VERY ready to finally get risky","12713":"And before you think of replying: I'm aware a pride is a group of Lions.","12714":"Don\u2019t worry, you\u2019ll get this guy in about 5-8 years","12715":"It was pretty repulsive last year, but for different reasons","12716":"How did you do?","12717":"Please keep saying the same joke over and over again it\u2019s funnier each time","12718":"Would you please shut up.","12719":"Can the mods ban this fucking bot","12720":"You are off this account for a year and come back to say this stuff, lol.","12721":"So they got the typical Carolina treatment. Life is indeed sometimes fair.","12722":"Whats your opinion of Claypool?","12723":"He'll sue","12724":"Obviously you've never seen Avatar: The Last Airbender.","12725":"what secondary?","12726":"Why? You'll get him in a few years anyway!","12727":"We need those","12728":"Whoever did Jake Eason\u2019s must not be a fan of him","12729":"I wish it didn\u2019t take up literally half the card","12730":"It\u2019s amazing how many kids at Riverside that are good football players either transfer out or play other sports","12731":"Fun fact: A group of Panthers is called a prowl or leap.","12732":"Just block him tbh. It's what I'm about to do. Much easier than waiting for the mods to (probably not) ban him, it's like banning him from your Reddit, site wide. I think I have like 80% of the people that subbed to the_donald blocked for some reason or another","12733":"Claypool is raw but is a mauler. Insane run blocker and special teams demon. Guy knows hes 6'4 230 and if he gets the ball in his hands he makes sure the DB also knows and feels how big he is. Needs route running polish but should be good\n\n\nAs a note on Pride, I hope your DB coach can teach him some ball skills. I've never seen a DB always be in the right position to make a play but literally have no clue where the ball is but that was his life at ND","12734":"I fucking LOVE Claypool. Admittedly I\u2019m a little biased but he\u2019s stupid athletic for his size and really uses his body to box out defenders. He\u2019s also versatile in that he played all over the field this year and can block like a tight end. Needs to clean up his footwork big time Cause he sometimes used his size\/athleticism to just Moss defenders in college, which he won\u2019t be able to do in the league. Good coaching will go a long way with him but he can contribute right away in a limited role.","12735":"Tell'em, twinkle toes.","12736":"But panthers aren't even an animal","12737":"The picks are starting to flyyyy","12738":"Herbert is at least  stepping into a very good situation on offense. He will have every chance to succeed","12739":"Ooooooooooo I love this pick","12740":"I CANT KEEP UP","12741":"Could someone educate about this man? I wish I knew more about this pick.","12742":"brb gonna go watch youtube highlights","12743":"The picks are on here before espn is announcing them","12744":"Chargers have had an amazing draft","12745":"Solid RB talent now sliding into the 4th is pretty weird to see.","12746":"Looks like a great 1-2 with Ekeler!!","12747":"They\u2019re rolling thru these picks","12748":"Fantastic young man. Extremely articulate, great leader, always happy, runs hard and became a lone bright spot on some terrible UCLA teams. One of my favorite players to watch!","12749":"Chargers know what they\u2019re doing with running backs","12750":"Perfect compliment to Ekeler","12751":"Really nice pick. Kelley is awesome","12752":"is it just me or did they show highlights of a different player? They definitely showed highlights of a corner back\n\nedit: nvm ESPN is behind. I was watching the Holmes clip when I saw this","12753":"Steal.","12754":"Staying local and same color scheme. Good for him.","12755":"Excited for this guy","12756":"Great receiving back which is odd since they already have Ekeler but ok then.","12757":"No.","12758":"Praise tha Lord","12759":"And their defense is monstrous. All around they\u2019re filled with talent. Excited to see him play if he makes it on the field this season.","12760":"Except for left tackle and the WR corps behind Allen.","12761":"I'm hoping Mike Wiliams starts to shine","12762":"As a Ucla fan so do I. One of my favorite bruins","12763":"There's Viagra for that my man","12764":"Pretty good. He\u2019s been BPA for a while. Remember seeing him in a few UCLA games last year.","12765":"Strong downhill runner who is good in short yardage situations. Good pick considering you guys didn't really have a back like that. Compliments the speed and agility that you have in Ekeler and Jackson.","12766":"Doesn\u2019t have a lot of wiggle, more of a north south back with a real punch to himbut offers what you want out of that role while also being a plus blocker ad showing natural receiving skills on his limited targets. An nfl speed program will be very helpful and I\u2019d guess his best ball is in a couple of years since you don\u2019t really expect this kid to let up in the work department.\n\nProbably best in a one cut scheme and I think he could be good used in Melvin Gordon\u2019s role. \n\nOne thing you\u2019re really getting is a tireless worker who has a reputation as an extremely good locker room presence.","12767":"Watch his highlights against usc","12768":"NFL network is keeping up if you have it","12769":"NFL_Mod is drafting for everybody today","12770":"At first I was upset at Herbert, but the more I sit and see we got a stellar linebacker, and now a promising Runningback I feel like tons better.","12771":"Tom Telesco is an amazing GM. We are extremely lucky to have him. He\u2019s had his misses as most GMs have but he has hit it big a lot.","12772":"Personally, I really like Herbert, but I knew some would push back on him. But when we traded up for Murray, that was absolutely fire. I'm so excited to see Murray in that defense. Absolutely worth the trade of the 3rd round pick.\n\nKelley and everyone else will just be icing on the cake.","12773":"And break the law","12774":"You think Tyrod is gonna lock up the starter job all season? Lol","12775":"The roster is usually good, the problem is that it's the same list as the injury report halfway through the season","12776":"Can\u2019t have a perfect offense. Also mike Williams is a fantastic WR2","12777":"He\u2019s been shining dude lmao\n\nJust had a 1000 yard season as a WR2","12778":"Single handedly beat USC a few years back with almost 300 rushing yards in the game. He can step it up when called upon.","12779":"So fun to watch the last few years, he\u2019s going to be fantastic for the Chargers","12780":"What should I know about the corner we just took","12781":"Preach, dude. I didn\u2019t see this pick coming but I\u2019m ecstatic. One of my favorite Bruins is staying home!","12782":"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=dNVxnAo6D6Q\n\nlinked it because i went to watch it\n\nSeems to have really good vision. His combine stats list him at 212 lbs, but the ticker says 200 in game. I feel like he played a lot bigger than 200 lb honestly. Decisive as well, picks his spot and goes. Could be a great compliment to Eckler.","12783":"Thank you","12784":"Exactly how I feel. Let\u2019s give Herbert a year to adjust then start him in 2021.","12785":"Don't let all the armchair GMs convince you that your QB that has been a highly touted prospect for 2 years is automatically gonna bust. Trust me I hope he sucks for you guys but I think it's a little silly for everyone to think he's sooooo bad when he likely would have been one of the first 2 QBs off the board even if he came out last year.","12786":"He can't draft Oline.","12787":"Lol that's bullshit.","12788":"I take what\u2019s mine","12789":"Lol no I\u2019m not saying he\u2019s good. But maybe they want to be patient with Herbert","12790":"Fantastic? Based on what? He's more like an acceptable WR3.","12791":"1000 yard season by 1 yard with only 2 touchdowns man :P\n\nI feel like Williams can *dominate* with a QB that can utilize him. I'm talking star level. Household name level.","12792":"Five star recruit out of high school. Underachieved cause our defense sucked balls. He a little slow but supposedly he has good ball skills. Honestly don\u2019t know how he\u2019s gonna do in the NFL lol. Gun to my head he\u2019s prolly gonna be a bust like Paul Perkins","12793":"Great ball skills but seemed to not give a fuck last couple years with team changes and lack of talent. Definitely got drafted on athleticism more than production because we sucked absolute donkey balls the last 2 years.","12794":"At Ucla he turned 2 yard runs or loses into 4 or 5 yard gains consistently. He just knew how to drive a little more. Watch his highlights against usc. Prolly his best game.","12795":"He loves running into and through contact. Absolute nightmare to tackle.","12796":"I\u2019ve followed him throughout college and have never been a fan. I never care for Oregon QBs in general, but I really didn\u2019t want him, but I gotta accept it lol","12797":"And take some more","12798":"With the potential for training camp and stuff to get cancelled, letting a rookie QB sit for a lot or most of this tear may be an even smarter decision so they can really learn the playbook and the way the NFL works","12799":"WR3\u2019s get 1000 yards receiving? Lay off the meth","12800":"Yeah I agree but you have to remember the chargers offense is loaded with skill players. They spread the ball around a lot. Their RB had 1000 yards receiving too. \n\nHe\u2019s 2 years off a 10 TD season too","12801":"1001 yards on 49 receptions!!!!","12802":"This comment is so confusing. Holmes ran a 4.48 at the Combine and a 4.32 as a high schooler, which made him the fastest recruit at his position. And then you say he's gonna bust like Paul Perkins, who's a RB? Why did you use that comparison?","12803":"He's a little slow? He ran a 4.49 at the combine. I wouldn't call that slow, especially for a RB.","12804":"It rains it pours","12805":"Strong defense or good ST, pick one. With the Chargers, you can't have both :(","12806":"Tyrell Williams was belittled as a WR3 even though he racked up 1000yd seasons, so you should probably find a better point of argument genius.","12807":"That's what I mean though, I don't think Eck has that much utilization with a QB that won't dump off like Rivers did.\n\nI think everyone took my comment as a negative when it was a massive compliment lmao whatever","12808":"People are not reading my comment right lmao","12809":"I was referring to Paul Perkins not panning out with the giants even though I had high expectations for him","12810":"He\u2019s talking about Darnay Holmes","12811":"He was talking about a corner, I think","12812":"We do though. We were top 5 ST last year for most of the year.","12813":"He was the WR1 when he got 1000 yards you clown LMAO","12814":"We need to go from Ekeler getting the ball via dump offs to Ekeler catching passes on the perimeter by design. He\u2019s too good not to feed.","12815":"Oh lol you're right. Since this thread is about Kelley, I assumed that entire paragraph was about Kelley. I was confused when he brought up the defense, but I assumed he meant that put a lot of pressure on the offense. That's what I get for skim reading.","12816":"We did however lose some key ST guys... Adrian Philips, Derek watt, Dzunbar, and Jatavis Brown were valuable on special teams","12817":"We were the bottom ST unit according to DVOA last season.","12818":"Agree everywhere except Dzubnar. The only thing he was good at was getting his numbers on screen (cause he was always laid out missing a tackle).","12819":"Watt and Phillips were the only differnce makers on ST. Dzunbar was trash and I'm tired of people acting like he wasn't, Jatavis was good his 1st year but regressed more each year after that.","12820":"Do you have a source? Because i know i read like 3 articles last year in like week 9ish when we were top 5 in the league.","12821":"https:\/\/www.footballoutsiders.com\/stats\/nfl\/team-efficiency\/2019\n\nHere you go. ST is the last column.","12822":"https:\/\/www.pff.com\/news\/pro-nfl-special-teams-rankings-through-week-17\n\nI'll trust PFF over \"football outsiders\" 10 times out of 10.","12823":"Football outsiders are the people who calculate DVOA, it\u2019s not some fly by night operation.  Essentially the stat accommodates for opponent quality. It\u2019s a different metric from PFF and the ST rank probably sat in between. Not saying they were last but that the DVOA metrics had them ranked last and from watching the team last season I don\u2019t think we were a top ST unit.\n\nEdit: Just realized your PFF article is from week 17 of the 2018 season, chargers were much better in 2018 compared with 2019.","12824":"Once again, we'd like to thank [sportsreference.com](https:\/\/www.sports-reference.com\/) for helping out with college stats for our draft cards.

Bleacher Report is like 5 minutes ahead of them.","12831":"Gonna never let Tua get hit","12832":"WALL OF TUA","12833":"you love to see it","12834":"Go Dawgs!","12835":"Literally Building a Wall for Tua","12836":"Solid pick here Fins.","12837":"I'm loving the Dolphins draft. Get your franchise QB and draft linemen like there's no tomorrow to protect him","12838":"BUILD THE WALL","12839":"Thats a good pick","12840":"Dolphins crushing it","12841":"Protect Tua","12842":"Good news for Tua","12843":"Let\u2019s build our O-line in one draft","12844":"People saying they're building a wall for Tua. Looking at their scouting reports it's looking more like they're building a run first O and a defense they dare you to throw on. Reminds me of Seattle in Wilson's early years. \n\nAs a Fins fan I can definitely get behind this way if thinking.","12845":"Big Fish to the Fish","12846":"Those knee braces are fire","12847":"omg steal of the draft","12848":"Two tackles two guards, and already have a center. Now teach Mike G to block and we will BUILD A FUCKING WALL!","12849":"Jealous of this one. Feels like he could get to the level that Kelechi Osemele once was.","12850":"BUILDATANKFORTUA","12851":"That really is your strat and I don't blame you","12852":"Gotta get those stories of the worst day of a pick's life aired","12853":"Gotta protect him. Robotic hips are expensive!","12854":"Man how many Georgia lineman have been selected? I feel like I\u2019ve seen at least three","12855":"Would you say it is a steal perhaps?","12856":"Lord you should see the Dolphins Facebook of all the fans talking about how Grier and BFlo fucked up everything and how they totally botched the draft. One dude said Tua will never play a down in the NFL.","12857":"RON MEXICO WILL PAY FOR IT!","12858":"Have you SEEN our Oline? This is probably the best idea considering even rookies are better than what we had last year","12859":"excuse me","12860":"TANKS FOR TUA","12861":"Yep, 3. Should be at least 2 more in next year\u2019s draft. Georgia\u2019s really building their case to be a modern O-line U!","12862":"At least it looks like it's a minority that are taking such an absurd take.","12863":"Well we did have Ron New Mexico on our team at one point","12864":"Yea, we are mammals bro.","12865":"We talk about how bad Reddit and Twitter are while Facebook is like a kiddie pool of elephant shit in mid-summer heat.","12866":"Definitely the minority but my God the idiots you see on there. Facebook truly is the lowest IQ on the internet","12867":"Damn they\u2019re sprinting through the fourth round","12868":"31 credits, in a summer, holy cow.","12869":"We drafted a NERD!?!?!?","12870":"ESPN fucking sucks \n\n3 commercials rigt before our 4 picks\n\nWe are now 3 slections ahead of these talking heads and all becayse they feel the need to go to commercials every 5 pucks","12871":"I like this as a depth pick and likely special teams player.","12872":"Wanted a center. I'll take em","12873":"Well that\u2019s not a pass rusher. \n\nDoes anybody know anything about this guy? Literally haven\u2019t read a thing about him in draft prep.","12874":"i mean...i guess...","12875":"These picks are coming in too fast. I can\u2019t keep up","12876":"Was not expecting CB at all in this draft lol","12877":"Boy we are really challenging our edge rushers to step up","12878":"Sounds like a good CB","12879":"Still no dead family","12880":"Some notes on Darnay Holmes:\n\n- 3 year starter for UCLA as a primarily outside corner (only 16 snaps in the slot in 2019)\n- Allowed 94 receptions on 162 targets in his career with 8 INTS and 14 TDs allowed\n- Player Comp: Janoris Jenkins\n- Very instinctive, loves to jump routed, but has the tendency to bite on double moves (similar to Jenkins)\n- Very good between the 20s, but has struggled in the red zone in his career","12881":"Sounds like this guys is a pretty good player for a 4th round pick","12882":"Welcome to the Giants, Darnay!","12883":"We needed a center, 2 years ago.","12884":"Is DG allergic to a pass rush?","12885":"Damn","12886":"31 UNITS? breh","12887":"[Gimme that ball, bitch](https:\/\/youtu.be\/KSydNa16_tA)","12888":"Got a CB name","12889":"All i remember about him is he really struggled against Washington state, hope he does well with the giants","12890":"Are we gonna be the Chicago Bears of corner backs?","12891":"Steal","12892":"Greatest player ever drafted","12893":"So who is this guy??","12894":"Eh","12895":"This guy will be a stud bank on it. One of the most impressive players coming out of high school I can remember he just unfortunately went to UCLA lol","12896":"Excited to see how he plays without our (UCLA) cancer at defensive coordinator","12897":"Takis ew","12898":"Already have too many young CB\u2019s when they need an EDGE and linebacker most followed by center and WR. Bad pick","12899":"They got like four rounds to go through today right? No fucking around today","12900":"Fucking damn near more impressive than being drafted to the NFL.","12901":"Hahaha whaaaaaat","12902":"What's average over a summer semester, like 10 credits or something?","12903":"How else is the NFL going to make money?","12904":"Our special teams was already good and Judge is a ST coach. We also just lost Michael Thomas who was a great STer. I'm not surprised at all by this pick.","12905":"Didn\u2019t even think about ST but I\u2019m sure Judge has been scouting that. With Thomas gone that would be a cool pickup","12906":"He is also very young with a huge amount of raw talent. He just needs to improve his technique and become consistent. If he is able to do so, he will be a very good player. If he fails, he only cost us a 4th round pick.","12907":"Dad played in the NFL as a rb","12908":"He's going to be money in the nickel, he doesn't fill a need but he's still a good player","12909":"A pass rusher in the fourth isn\u2019t gonna do anything for us. We will work on d line next year. 2021 is our year.","12910":"How many corners under the age of 23 do you have on roster lol. Beal, Baker, Love (I know you want him as FS but won\u2019t Peppers and McKinney be your starting S?), and now Holmes","12911":"This is a pick","12912":"He\u2019s going to be a very good nickelback, just needs more time to get better","12913":"He's a good player, no he doesn't fill a need but I'm not upset with him. We got torched in the slot last season, I think he can be tremendous help there","12914":"I sort of like the strategy, give the secondary every resource they could need. Sounds like he might be a fit for slot corner where they still have a need","12915":"why did we even draft him?","12916":"Tyler Biadasz would\u2019ve been cool but I trust Gettleman\u2019s drafting","12917":"Anthony Gordon is pretty good and their air raid system is good. Can\u2019t say I\u2019ve ever heard of this guy though so idk what to think","12918":"Welcome to the patriot influence. Always start camp with like 20","12919":"110th steal","12920":"He shoulda gone to Ohio State like his nephew wanted lol","12921":"Frankly, if you're trying to fill needs in the 4th Round, you're already fucked.  Just take the best player on your board.","12922":"I don\u2019t get these fucking comments. An edge in the fourth won\u2019t push the needle for us. We will get edge next year, this team isn\u2019t there quite yet to compete, 2021 is our time","12923":"I think it was 9 credits when I was in school.","12924":"Honestly tho when is it enough money. When is it enough sob stories for ratings. When is enough enough for these people.","12925":"So he has NFL bloodlines like every other player in this year's draft.","12926":"Priest Holmes ?!","12927":"Dad is an asshole though. Holmes was going to commit to Ohio State in the same class as Okudah but his dad was buddies with the UCLA DB coach, so they had a 'family meeting' before the night of his commitment where his Dad told him he needed to go to UCLA.\n\nHolmes may have been a first rounder if he went to Ohio State as he and Okudah were ranked comparatively coming out of high school.","12928":"Shrug\n\nIf the pass rush is going to be shit, may as well lockdown the deep field \ud83d\ude39","12929":"Love is gonna be our nickel now probably.","12930":"Love can play slot as well","12931":"Ballentine too","12932":"Good, can't have too many corners and our young guys haven't exactly lived up to the task yet","12933":"James Bradberry 26\nDeAndre Baker 22\nSam Beal 23\nGrant Haley 24\nCorey Ballentine 24\n\nAnd now...\n\nDarnay Holmes 21\n\nAnd that\u2019s not including Julian Love 22 who we converted to FS last year.","12934":"I do too.","12935":"Biadasz has injury concerns IIRC.","12936":"he bit real hard on a stutter go multiple times and gave up some big plays, recovery speed looked average to me","12937":"108 steals in this draft, but then, Love Hurts","12938":"Every pick from here on out is a steal","12939":"Pretty obvious he actually wanted to do the school part and not take all online gender studies classes ;)","12940":"Never.","12941":"How many dead parents?

Interesting pick then. Was hoping we\u2019d get a pass rusher or a center","12947":"I don\u2019t know how well known it is but I went to high school with him and the rumor has always been that his dad forced him to go to UCLA","12948":"We don't even have Golden anymore lmao. Our pass rush is such trash.","12949":"Y\u2019all better hope Gettleman decides to trade for Ngakoue lmao","12950":"I don't think we expect to be good this year anyway, so it's whatever for now. As long as Daniel Jones has all the help he can get so we can see what he really is, I'm happy with 2020.","12951":"I mean besides maybe some WR additions he has elite RB, a solid line now, and a good TE. Hope he does well","12952":"and Saquon. we need to give that guy a chance to make it to the line of scrimmage...","12953":"I honestly think with the improvements to the line he could be great this year also I hope engram can finally stay healthy.

Not really a comment on the skins taking him.","13162":"If we\u2019re really referring to Charles as \u201chorrible character\u201d then I think it\u2019s safe to say all of our teams have a few of them.","13163":"Aldon Smith?","13164":"Zeke molested a woman","13165":"Yeah all our guys just smoke weed, and all of reddit swears that doesn't mean anything so","13166":"David Irving?","13167":"Smile because it\u2019s over now!","13168":"Ah yes, because those are the only two talented players with character issues to come out in each of the last two drafts \ud83d\ude02","13169":"the jazz cabbage","13170":"And Scherff\/Thomas Davis\/Kerrigan etc. Also like Trent wasnt a pothead either lol","13171":"I'm still coming to terms that Bruce Allen can't hurt us anymore.","13172":"Devil's Lettuce bro, no lie. Hopefully Riverboat Ron can ferry this sinking sailboat to shallow waters.","13173":"We\u2019re trying to replace Trent - we needed someone who couldn\u2019t follow simple shit like that.","13174":"I'll give you that. Premium position at an elite school. That blunt cost him a ton of money.","13175":"Well we did just get rid of Trent.... who did the exact same thing.\n\nWe aren't sure it is weed. It could be worse. Anyways, I like this pick much more with us having Rivera as opposed to Jay Gruden. Love Jay, but that dude was not exactly a disciplinarian.","13176":"No he didn't. Had he done that she would press charges, mainly because she had proof (we all saw that video). I've been in parties and I've seen that kind of stuff happening and when the woman isn't receptive things would go to shit instantly. That wasn't the case there.","13177":"Yeah, people on this sub are a bunch of hypocrites. They say it shouldn't be a problem if a player smokes weed (and o agree) but if it's a Cowboys player it's the end of the world.","13178":"He has a problem with weed and he gave up football for it, but he never seemed a bad person.","13179":"Didn\u2019t draft him and then basically let him go when he was acting up","13180":"Yeah trent was in stage 2 of the substance abuse program. \n\nHe failed two tests. \n\nHe was one more away from a year long suspension. \n\nAnd they know when the fucking tests are.","13181":"And no weed isn\u2019t a problem (not that it really was)","13182":"The fucking jazz cabbage.","13183":"\/r\/igropewomen","13184":"that\u2019s fair. wasn\u2019t he like smoking weed on IG live one time when he was already suspended?","13185":"It's a problem in the sense that regardless of how dumb it is its still not allowed and itll cost you playing time\/hurt the team.","13186":"After he retired, or the day he retired, he did that. If I'm not mistaken that was the way he announced he was going to retire because he didn't agree with the motives for his suspension.","13187":"I thought it was allowed in the new cba?","13188":"What are you talking about?  It\u2019s no longer tested for in the new CBA","13189":"lmao legendary","13190":"I could've worded it better but I'm talking about before, smoking weed is a really dumb thing to lose money\/playing time over","13191":"Oh yeah, of course","13192":"Bengals killing this draft","13193":"Ok I like this pick a lot. I\u2019m stressed out about our line but this is great.","13194":"So fucking happy with this draft","13195":"Trey: \u201chis father....\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cyes! tell me how he was eaten by a coyote\u201d\n\nTrey: \u201c.... was a successful college coach\u201d\n\nMe: \u201cshit\u201d.","13196":"STEAL OF THE DRAFT!","13197":"These guys don\u2019t know how to say Appalachian","13198":"Possibly the best player drafted ever.","13199":"Not a fan of Cincy having good drafts, but fuck it let\u2019s try to have three of the best teams in football","13200":"Steal","13201":"#APP","13202":"They\u2019re doing a good job....I don\u2019t like it","13203":"Another 'Neer off the board!

Nice pick.","13216":"I literally predicted pre-draft that the Bengals would get this guy.\n\nHe's a steal in round 4. I love what we're (finally) doing with our linebacker group.","13217":"Damn, was hoping we'd get him since we need all the help we can get on D","13218":"Reach. Also a steal","13219":"Didn\u2019t brugler just say he had a bone on bone condition?","13220":"Aaaaaaand we're off!","13221":"Was really hoping (wishful thinking, I know) that goodell kept announcing picks haha","13222":"I like him but his durability scares me.","13223":"Great pick! We needed LB help BADLY. Now I'm hoping we go OL.","13224":"MY BOY\n\nKiller pick, the dude is a stud.","13225":"So the redskins traded with the lions for this pick, now the trade is not going on and Lions trade out of their 109 pick to the Raiders? \n\nLol what's happening.","13226":"Damn and I thought he would be a 7th rounder because of the fucked up knee.","13227":"[The face of a draft killer](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/ADugPfT.jpg)","13228":"They always draft exceptionally well. That's one of the few things Marvin did well and those lessons seem to be learned.","13229":"Easy when you pick first. Our second rounder is basically a first rounder, our third basically a second, etc.","13230":"Alright Suzuki","13231":"We get Jonah this year and by the end of last year there was definite improvement. Would love to get another player this draft still, but overall I've been happy","13232":"Why did you have to get 2 of the LB I really liked. Stop making good picks please!","13233":"App State alumnus here. This man is a MONSTER and I think you\u2019re getting great value given he\u2019s a smaller school product.","13234":"It'll help Joe build character","13235":"A young qb doesn't need a line! Just ask Andrew Luck!","13236":"I'm so happy for Bengals fans","13237":"Your draft + solid FA and you got yourself a nice turnaround (or at least outlook). Not gonna crown you a contender, but on paper that\u2019s how you rebuild.

Absolutely wild.","13246":"You joke, but this is a really good pick if the injury concerns posted earlier aren't too bad.","13247":"Jokes aside, the guys on NFL radio love this guy and have been really talking him up. Dude is chiseled out of granite.","13248":"Knee.","13249":"****STATE****","13250":"What an incredible draft for us. This could be huge for recruiting for years.

Especially for us.","13269":"I always think this logic is funny because those who pick last say the opposite -- \"our first is basically a second, our second is basically a third\"","13270":"I mean yes but you can't still fuck up and you've done the opposite","13271":"There\u2019s probably a starting caliber guard that can be an improvement in round 5.

That can't be good for recruiting. \n\nWho do you think gets their shot next year? I'm thinking Sutton if he balls out. I'm not sure about Zac's chances, unfortunately. QB at a small school with heavy run emphasis doesn't catch many eyes in the NFL.","13288":"I won't even be mad if all 3 of us are good if it means the Steelers go 0-6 in the AFCN. Fuck em","13289":"Also for giving Bush away to Pittsburgh","13290":"i'll flat out say i root for the ravens when they dont play us.  i actually like and respect them as an organization.","13291":"Comrade Goodell","13292":"Ha it's very telling that we have had a great draft, made huge off-season moves, and still think our defense is striving toward \"decent\".\n\nLast year was rough.","13293":"Saying just North Carolina always means UNC","13294":"This is what happens when you smack the [Bingle Barrel] (https:\/\/youtu.be\/MIm_UxiyEBA) boys","13295":"To be fair I don\u2019t remember the last time a 1st rounder played their first year in the league","13296":"WJ3 was good, but Price was undeniably a bust","13297":"Our main strategy seems to be not drafting linemen because we always screw that up","13298":"Definitely.

These aren't exactly players getting left out because they don't really fit people's needs. Especially for the OTs, players rated a hell of a lot lower than these two are flying off the shelves while they remain up for grabs.\n\nWonder why that is for these players. For Trey Adams and Hunter Bryant, being a Husky fan, I know that teams have to have concerns about their injury tendencies, but for Trey Adams especially you'd think they've still shown more than enough talent to warrant a gamble in the 5th or 6th round.

Slick Draft Pick Rick is mining value here.\n\nWe don't have much use for the crazy amount of picks we had.

I mean he\u2019d be a good backup QB but watching Georgia the past two years all he\u2019s done is declined.

You just never know how the chips will fall. Many people said he was the 5th best QB prospect in this year's draft too","15485":"No no no. This is the Packers guy no question about it.","15486":"Eagles couldn't get Lamb so they took his QB. Big Clit move by Howie","15487":"Creamy....","15488":"Found Kelvin Benjamin","15489":"upvoted!","15490":"From TMZ","15491":"Son probably also got a hole in 1 on all 18 holes.","15492":"Isn't he a kicker for the Chargers or something","15493":"If that happens I want you to annihilate us this season until the pain numbs","15494":"I seriously would not even be surprised by this happening.","15495":"I'd take the Eagles draft over ours in a heartbeat","15496":"I think they said 7 yesterday? \n\nAnd you loved the Love pick?

Last year I don't know what happened, he was NOT sharp. Is it concussions, is it drugs, is it work ethic? Maybe NFL teams know something we don't, or what's not in media. Good coaching and professional environment could possibly bring out the 17 and 18 Jake, and improve on that. He is still a young man. He doesn't have HOF talent, but he is a gamer, and he can play NFL QB at his best.","15514":"At least they\u2019re in the NFL, unlike DJ who never made it.","15515":"The North Dakota Norsemen","15516":"This is the way.","15517":"But how does that help you win now?","15518":"Lmao","15519":"I'd say he's much much better than McCarron and McElroy. But a lot of good nfl QBs are smart players and doesn't necessarily have great arms. He has a good arm, can make long throws when needed. He's a good QB in west coast offense. I know he was off his game last year but look at the tape from the earlier seasons. I don't get this.","15520":"Put him in west coast offense, doesn't need great arm strength. Brady isn't particularly strong armed. He makes quick decisions (last year he was off). Is ball-safe. Brees and Wilson aren't tall either. And Fromm is fairly mobile. I do remember him scrambling in national champ game for some big chunk against Bama.","15521":"Also far less likely to be a Neo-Nazi.","15522":"The next dictator is unlikely to be a Kim; Jong-un was the last man in that line, and North Korea is unlikely to make his sister or young daughter the next leader. Ready for a power struggle in a rogue nuclear-armed state?","15523":"Considering neurosurgeons make absolute bank I'm pretty sure he doesn't regret it.","15524":"I had him as a round 5 or 6 lock. They must be stuck on his 40 and physical attributes, not a speedster but man is he efficient. More Importantly, he is one of the most consistent WR if not players I have ever seen at Ohio State.  Honestly makes no sense to me","15525":"Fair point","15526":"Mel Kiper lives for the NFL draft. This is his peak of the year. He hasn't slept since Wednesday","15527":"Swedish fish are so Chalky","15528":"Well they had a Luke Bryan mini concert about 30 minutes ago lmao","15529":"They\u2019re drafting well, and this whole offseason they\u2019ve been pulling shit.","15530":"At least you guys have the really cool stripy throwbacks...","15531":"Thanks","15532":"why not make that coffee Irish?","15533":"Mmmmm. Coffee flavored beer. A couple of shots. Pass out by 6th round. I love it when a plan comes together.","15534":"Love is the best pick weve made Haha","15535":"Our sub is full of children.

I would have followed your idea.","15550":"oh damn. didn't see that yet. thanks for info","15551":"No, it'll be a kicker or long snapper obviously","15552":"Their lesser known, evolved form.","15553":"Football smarts of one, intangibles and physical traits of the other. \n\nSuper QB.","15554":"Did he come off as unintelligent or what?

I like it","15561":"By some god awful curse, it usually lines up with the ticker going away too >.>","15562":"No they weren't. They talked about the Chiefs pick as it happened.","15563":"Only reason I watch","15564":"Thanks man. What's funny is I'm sure on Monday when I (against my better judgement) look at draft grades we'll get like, a C- or something. Wish we could start the season tomorrow","15565":"We need serious help at that position, and while Duvernay is a good pick, I think we need to attack it more.\n\nRavens fans will just scream O LINE DEPTH O LINE DEPTH O LINE DEPTH if you disagree with any picks though.","15566":"*sigh*","15567":"Dude, after 20 years of Brady, I need a break.","15568":"I am","15569":"blasphemy...!!! LOL","15570":"I'm not really tbh","15571":"They probably wouldn't have taken him anyways based on what we have seen","15572":"Completely missed that Cepheus got drafted with this awful coverage from ESPN","15573":"Haha I mean for the whole league with updated draft picks","15574":"Word. Do you know where I can find a good updated roster in the coming week(s)?

I don't even want them","15642":"Thanks!","15643":"She's way more rnb than rap, she has a bunch of good songs to be honest","15644":"Nothing lowkey about it","15645":"Maybe you can but a lot of your fanbase won\u2019t be able to","15646":"Yeah, I\u2019m sure they probably talked to him about his views because something like that could cause a big negative reaction from fans","15647":"Eventually, after 20 years of never drafting a single player, the Vikings have every pick in the draft.","15648":"It's been a long day I apologize","15649":"This is anything but a safe space lol","15650":"Last year he was off, never got into rhythm with his receivers. Look at the prior years. He makes quick decisions, his release is quick, he is ball safe, and he throws with accuracy in the 10-20 yard window. That's all you need in the NFL. He plays well in big games; he was great in the nat. championship game vs. Tua, and in the SEC title game too. This dropping to 5th or 6th is going to make him hungrier. I liked him before, now I like him even more as the disparaged young talent, the underdog. He has the smarts, and now I want to see him show character which are apparently his strong traits.","15651":"No we traded it","15652":"I hate to say but i agree rn Hebert will bust imo","15653":"I thought they would wait until the 2nd round for Hurts","15654":"Why didn\u2019t you want Herbert??","15655":"Well the good news is you won't have to watch him until like 5 games into the season.","15656":"Actually laughed out loud to this","15657":"I'M OLD GREGGGGG","15658":"Seeing hubris like that get punished is cathartic.","15659":"Because he's a qb with all the talent in the world but he needs to sit for a few years. He goes to a team with a great qb where he can sit for a few years. Packers fans are gonna be happy in a few years when they need him and he shows up.","15660":"Sounds like \"really good.\" Guess we'll see.","15661":"It\u2019s Reddit you never know","15662":"Sush","15663":"That's what they said about Brady too. Watch his tape from previous years, not last year. He was definitely off his game, never got rhythm with his receivers. I watched a lotta SEC football.","15664":"Can't miss out on a steal in the 7th round if you own every pick in the 7th round.","15665":"i'm out here at the dmz right now with my patriots throwback flag just doing my thang","15666":"Not at all, he always planned to be a neurosurgeon and not an NFL player.  FSU allowing him to have the flexibility to do the necessary classes to get into med school was the primary reason he went there.","15667":"Well they technically traded up from the 2021 draft? Lol","15668":"but all I have in the house is beer and wine atm :'(","15669":"I know man it's ridiculous buncha armchair GMs","15670":"I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll compete with you guys for the division but I could see them being in the fight for the third wildcard spot. In the 8-8\/9-7 range.","15671":"What's that about","15672":"At the very least it was a reach","15673":"[...](https:\/\/i.imgur.com\/WvK9YhX.gifv)","15674":"*ahem*. THE FUCK.","15675":"ChiMo confirmed.","15676":"What posts? All I've seen is football shit","15677":"LOL.","15678":"Yeah the reports are that he didn't really give a shit and didn't take things seriously enough. Even if Eason has all the talent in the world, Fromm's going to win people over with his smarts and attitude.","15679":"Because it was a special pick.","15680":"IKR. peeps don't get this kid. He's a grappa Brady clone.","15681":"Dude, we can breath now. Jake is not a Pat!","15682":"Ditto. I don't wanna see Belichek with another of his system QB.","15683":"The Evil Lemieux","15684":"Ugggghh. Hang in there and kick this things ass.","15685":"This is about on par with what they do during the 3rd day every draft tbh","15686":"It usually takes a few days before a good one comes out. I\u2019m sure there are a couple floating around right now with a 99 Joe Burrow","15687":"I usually just wait till i see a youtube video of it or wait for a c4 video.","15688":"You kicked COVID's ass. You'll make a great recovery.","15689":"damn bruh. Hoping for the best for you! stay positive!","15690":"When you see how bad we were stats wise last year it's easy to see why. D-line has been transformed in one draft. Wouldnt have minded Ben Bartch but he's a developmental O T.","15691":"I don\u2019t know what\u2019s more offensive the tattoo or that someone would put something on their body and not know what it means lmao","15692":"*Claims* hmm","15693":"We have a speed guy in MVS, but his route running (and effort, sometimes) is subpar. I\u2019ll take a crisp route runner any day.","15694":"Sorry. I'll definitely have it down after hes kneeling down for his 3rd Patriots SB win.","15695":"Oh, I forgot about that.","15696":"Yeah I'm sure there are a ton of Nebraska fans in here right now. Especially how good they've been the past decade.","15697":"[Why not both?](https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=vvdMLE6Tmvc)","15698":"Yeah, we went from having the best backup situation in the league last year whether it was Tanny or Marcus. Now we just have AAF superstar Logan Woodside as our backup.","15699":"Okay good because it wasn't very good and I'm not even a country hater lol","15700":"I mean, we know that. What ESPN believes and reality are two very different things.","15701":"Who\u2019s talking about rap? lol \nI didn\u2019t say country sucks, rap is better.\n\nHell, classical music is better.","15702":"I sure see people say this a lot but every time I watched it was the exact same bullshit human interest pieces and fluff you see on ESPN.","15703":"Ahh, makes sense. Get well soon! (Even though I will hate you once you're better)","15704":"He will be used as tsysom hill. Jon Gruden lol","15705":"yes","15706":"We definitely need a backup qb","15707":"Pace misunderstood this and has resigned Mike Glennon.","15708":"I like your optimism!","15709":"Yeah it's like a feeling of pride for ur city lol","15710":"He's hardly the best player left.","15711":"Hospital? Why are u there","15712":"Fair.  Just the first I pulled up was Slide.  Focus was better.  Any other recommendations?","15713":"I\u2019m still 22 or so years away from season tickets so if we can shave some time off that\u2019s fine with me","15714":"I see everyone else has watched the Brett Kollmann video too","15715":"is hurts in the 2nd good value? asking for a friend","15716":"Thanks, it's all I have left","15717":"Be gentle :(","15718":"But Rodgers has 4 years left on his contract. So it's a huge waste of a rookie contract","15719":"I've seen him in person at least once every year and watched plenty of Fromm. He definitely was off his rhythm last year but he also just doesn't have the arm talent, at all. It's no surprise he's falling. Kinda doubt he'll become the next Brady, not every late QB is a historic-tier draft fuckup. Reminds me more of Kellen Moore.","15720":"Oh, I thought they caught up.","15721":"Well I just spent nine days on a ventilator so I'm at least better than that. But this better not be \"recovered\" because it sucks ass.","15722":"Yeah I\u2019m not surprised, just disappointed lol","15723":"Thanks. Do you know of a good class to use just for now then? Like a lot of these guys getting drafted now are still mocked in the 2nd round for those rosters so it\u2019s a pain to adjust all the players. \n\nAnd lol @ 99 burrow. But the nba 2k draft classes are the worst. Not sure if you\u2019re familiar with that franchise but it\u2019s got Hall of Fame \u201cbadges\u201d which are kinda like superstar X-factors in madden, and half the downloadable classes will have guys like LaMelo Ball with 35 Hall of Fame badges. Obnoxious","15724":"C4? I\u2019ll have to check them out, thanks","15725":"Not before it kicked mine big time and I'm still not done","15726":"Projects at OT scare me. He pancaked a couple dudes in that highlight reel though, looked beastly.","15727":"Yeah, I make sure i research my tattoos well before I get them just for that reason haha","15728":"Either way its a good sign that he is smart enough to know how to answer the questio .","15729":"As a Steelers fan that sounds awful, as a Michigan fan \u00af\\\\\\_(\u30c4)\\_\/\u00af","15730":"I kinda forgot too lol","15731":"That was mostly a joke but they still point out how he's Rick Speilman's son...constantly.","15732":"Idk about that. They\u2019d do pieces here and there sure, but mayock would break down every pick just about. Not this espn bullshit where they don\u2019t even acknowledge multiple picks in a row. NFLN was noticeably better than ESPN back then.","15733":"Then it seems like a good pick for you guys.","15734":"Indeed and the little town next to us has a 5 star prospect as well.","15735":"Lol alright chief","15736":"Best part with Daniel Caesar is good","15737":"Nah i just dont trust the chargers to develop a qb cuz they haven't needed to for so long","15738":"It\u2019s on par with where he was supposed to go, he\u2019ll work out for y\u2019all","15739":"Yes, and even a good 1st","15740":"I disagree. If he turns out to be a viable replacement for Rodgers, then it's great use of a rookie contract.","15741":"It's unlikely but what if Rodgers isnt the same quality of player in a year or two.\n\nAlso you at least have a good back up in place *if* something does happen to Rodgers. I'm just trying look at the potential positives lol","15742":"He doesn't have a big arm. Same can be said of a lot of QBs in NFL including Brady. He has shown he can hit the 30-40 yard deep balls and that's enough in NFL. He's a west coast QB, and he'll thrive in there. And big arm doesn't mean jack if you can't throw it with accuracy. Have you seen Josh Allen? He can throw a ball 80 yards. It just won't be anywhere close to the receiver half the time.","15743":"Nope, but this is pretty standard for the NFL draft on day 3.","15744":"I\u2019m just gonna comment to check back later and see if you get a solid class lol","15745":"Yeah if your coaching aint good enough they wont do much, I think next year we'll take OT round 1 and a WR\/LB 2 maybe.","15746":"Yes he avoided it well but again that's PR move .  Oh well unless he's actually involved I wouldn't take it seriously for now","15747":"I know. I was kind of being a dick with the sarcasm. I'm sorry.","15748":"Man I have to say I think there are some **major** rose colored glasses going on for you here buddy. The exact same things would happen. Especially on Day 3.","15749":"That\u2019s fair too","15750":"You could say the same thing about a QB taken in the 6th round though","15751":"I just don't like trading up in the first for a Quarterback for an \"if\"","15752":"Yeah, I don't get why people are in a tizzy over it. The picks come in so fast at this point, they're bound to be behind. They're really going to love rounds 5-7.","15753":"So you think a player taken in the 6th is as likely to work out as a guy taken in the first? I'm guessing you were against the Rodgers pick?","15754":"Brady was in the 6th round. I think it just as likely to find someone from that round as the first who is actually better than Rodgers in the next 4 years.","15755":"Wow","15756":"Goggles Blankenship is on the menu for somebody today and that is enough for make me happy.","15757":"Kicker! A Kicker got drafted before Jake Fromm! Lol!","15758":"\"how do you gain 59 pounds?\"\n\nme mouthing: *roids*","15759":"QB: *gets picked*\n\nESPN: \"let's skip the next 15 picks to analyze this\"","15760":"Fuck ESPN. NFLN isn\u2019t always perfect but this is literally QB talk, coronavirus talk, and fucking music","15761":"ESPN, I will immediately recommend your coverage if you just put on a live shot of Belichick's dog the whole time, shove a bread roll down Riddick's throat and show us the actual contents of Kiper's bookshelf (dude has a fucking virtual background)","15762":"Fromm to the Eagles just to see Philly burn","15763":"Ragin Cajuns was always the team that I turned into a powerhouse in NCAA football. Name just cracked me up.","15764":"5 guys have gone since Morgan and they haven't said a word about any of them because they're too busy talking about fucking Jake Fromm.\n\nGod I hate ESPN","15765":"And she was like oh my god, this is my Fromm, he\u2019s been sitting on my draft board all night long","15766":"I was waiting for ESPN to sneak in \"his dad was murdered\" real quick between learning guitar and bowled a perfect game considering how excited they were to talk about him.","15767":"If the guy is not guilty, do we really need to know about this?  I'm sure it's a situation he wants to put behind him yet here is ESPN advertising it to the world.  That's one reason I get tired of sob stories.  These people should be allowed to live the lives they want to live.","15768":"The Titans should lose a pick for this","15769":"Guys, go to sleep , the draft ended already","15770":"I wish they'd show some of the shitty plays these guys make, just for some balance and perspective.","15771":"Guys we\u2019re in this together!","15772":"They don't have time to analyze any of the picks but have plenty of time for musical acts?  Why do they even broadcast the draft at this point?","15773":"I know we\u2019re in a pandemic and shit but holy fuck this ESPN coverage\/production has been the worst ever. Trying way too hard. Just give us the info without the unnecessary flair.","15774":"They really skipped 9 picks for Jake Fromm, Luke Bryan and commercials....","15775":"Why the hell are the Vikings trading back? They really plan on rostering 20 rookies or something?","15776":"Did ESPN tell all their analysts to disconnect?  Is the Draft over?  Is Roger Goodell going Grocery Shopping?  I don't think I've seen an actual pick since I got home and turned it back on.  ESPN is running a nice ad talking about missing sports but most of the coverage is about Covid-19 or musical acts.  I wanted to watch a sporting event in a time where I could not watch sporting events.  \n\nI miss Playoff Hockey or Baseball.  I would be watching that if there was an option but there isn't. :(","15777":"Dipping cheese-less pizza in mashed potatoes sounds revolting","15778":"Guys, don't forget that we're in this together, thanks to ESPN\n\nEdit: and thanks to Lowe's and BMW","15779":"The Redskins could have had better compensation had they traded him earlier!","15780":"Fromm passed over for a guy from FIU, ouch","15781":"Everyone else talking about how Eason is the guy and how he'll learn from Rivers and Brissett, and Mortensen coming in with realistic takes like \"He fell to the 4th for a reason, he'll get a shot to develop in a good situation, and if Indy doesn't see a fit they'll move on cuz it was just a 4th round pick\"","15782":"Lmao I cant stop laughing wtf is this out of nowhere","15783":"(Don't) Play It Again","15784":"Fucking hell straight from that to ads. \n\nESPN must've gotten bored of Sports in the short 3 days we have them kinda back.","15785":"Worth the wait to listen play it again. I have been waiting for 3 days for this","15786":"How fucking long is this song","15787":"ESPN is on pick 127...\n\n136 is selecting right now","15788":"Espn are so behind yet they still find time for Luke fucking Bryan","15789":"Imagine drafting by needs lol","15790":"I can safely say I havent followed a Play60 lifestyle in a long time...","15791":"I call bullshit on bowling that perfect game lol.","15792":"I\u2019m calling it now. Fromm to Detroit.","15793":"Fromm is a good pick for Buffalo","15794":"Myron Rolle is so much better at life than I am.","15795":"Stop with the fucking music","15796":"That was a cool song, but isn't this the draft? Why are we not announcing picks?","15797":"Why is it in 2020 the networks still don't know how to cover day three of the draft very well?  Is it just the speed of the picks and how they just can't catch up?  Is there a way for the coverage to be better, like sticking a camera towards everyone who is announcing picks and see them announce the picks?  Maybe it should be a duel production.  ESPN has a family of networks, and ABC can cover the music\/entertainment side of it.  ESPN can just have the annoucements of the picks.  And ESPN 2 could do the analysis and nothing by the analysis.  It would be like the College Football megacast.  Heck, then maybe ESPN News can be commercial free.  \n\nI just wonder in 2020 why it feels like the late rounds of drafts get short shrifted even though they say they cover the whole thing.","15798":"ESPN's coverage is officially 32 minutes behind the draft","15799":"Fuck you ESPN, don't call it a, \"Trade Alert\" if it happened 2 days ago.","15800":"lol wtf saints?","15801":"HE DOES *WHAT TO HIS PIZZA*","15802":"Obviously getting drafted in general is life changing, but I enjoy seeing the reaction of these guys that legitimately don't know IF they're gonna get drafted.  \n  \nLike, obviously Chase Young was happy to get drafted... but the dude probably already had a house picked out in DC.","15803":"Tae Crowder it is","15804":"Ah yes, Luke Bryan, that's what I tuned into see.\n\nNFL, bb, wat is u doin.","15805":"The last pick they talked about was 126. It's pick 134 right now and they're playing country music. Get fucked ESPN","15806":"Was not expecting to see Roger after last night lol","15807":"A player with disciplinary issues? Sounds perfect for Snyder.","15808":"Is nobody else graduating college from his family their version of tragedy?","15809":"I've probably watched every single pick of the draft since whenever my last Saturday baseball game was back in highschool (back when the draft was just saturday and sunday).  I normally question all my life choices at the end of the draft, but this year, with the quarantine?  Doing my part!","15810":"Daniel Jones really is Eli 2.0 lol.","15811":"7 mcfuckin eggs","15812":"That smoothie is disgusting. Just use peanut butter & banana for a milkshake!","15813":"Aurora, IL? Party on, Bartch","15814":"I didn't think Eason or Fromm would drop this far honestly.","15815":"Mel isn\u2019t paying attention, his brain is fried from sniffing all of the bath salts","15816":"Instead of a \"smoothie\", Eason eats a whole box of crayons.","15817":"Fromm really should have stayed in school","15818":"Key Departures: DeAndre Hopkins \n\nStill doesn't look right","15819":"Texans with a Heck-in good pick...","15820":"Teams: Drafting players\n\nESPN: Jake Fromm","15821":"I've only ever watched the NFL Network stream because I have GamePass and I will never take it for granted again. Eisen is a national fucking treasure\n\nFuck it, I even miss Steve Smith yelling unnecessarily at us.","15822":"Please stop this","15823":"So you have a country act and then more commercials letting you know how depressed we all should be at the moment?  I'm so glad the main TV watching I've been doing lately is on Amazon Prime where I don't see any commercials.","15824":"I am about to shoot a cell tower if I have to see this stupid verizon commercial again.\n\nWhy is it all day the same three fucking commercials?\n\nI miss Rich and Mayock on day three.","15825":"Is there anything worse than watching one of your draft crushes go to a division rival? I really wanted Troy Dye on the Packers.","15826":"We have a trade and ESPN doesn't talk about it.  This is where Sirius XM can come in and each team can broadcast the draft somehow on the play by play stations based on that individual team.  I don't know if what the 49ers just did was good and I care. :(","15827":"I was somewhat expecting the bears to pick Fromm there...  and I am not sure I would have hated that pick...","15828":"KICKER ALERT","15829":"Jake Fromm officially going to get drafted after the first kicker.","15830":"Fromm must've murdered someone. Huge slide","15831":"I did not expect Jake Fromm to be a later pick than Aaron Murray coming off an ACL tear was (163rd).","15832":"Oh my fucking god, ESPN, it's like they hire a private investigator for every prospect to see if anyone they've ever been close to has died since the year 2000.","15833":"LB is arguably the Packers' biggest need, anyone who thinks we only needed a WR didn't watch the NFC Championship Game.","15834":"Aaaand, mute ESPN","15835":"Holy fuck ESPN, you are literally 20 picks behind. Nearly a FULL ROUND behind... because you insist on showing musicians in their houses.","15836":"Finally dpj is drafted","15837":"Holy shit this slowed wayyyyy the fuck down.","15838":"Good god.. still talking about round 5 guys","15839":"It should be illegal to play the same commercial within a 1 minute time span","15840":"ESPN didn't advertise these musical interludes.\n\nFans don't want them.\n\nTherefore, exactly 0 people are watching this to see Imagine Dragons lip sync via zoom.","15841":"As a Notre Dame fan, calling Clausen a QB of the future was never a smart thing to do...","15842":"Holy shit Wayne Newton is still alive?","15843":"Mr. Irrelevant time, boys","15844":"Oh my god its almost over. Fucking finally. I can't believe I watched every minute of this shit","15845":"DONT PLAY IT AGAIN FOR THE LOVE OF CHRIST PLEASE DONT PLAY IT AGAIN","15846":"Well this is certainly a new level of terrible by ESPN.","15847":"This is so cringy.","15848":"Why does Goodell's eyebrow look like it is constantly raised in quizzical looks?","15849":"Raiders traded up \ud83d\udc40","15850":"Assuming Tua redshirts, he's going to come into a fantastic situation in his first real season.

Much-needed depth. He singlehandedly killed UVa in the Orange Bowl, though...","15855":"These BBQ Pork sliders I just made are the first real source of joy I've had since Thursday night.","15856":"I wish there was draft coverage that just showed the pick announcements. I don\u2019t need analysis 5 picks after it happened","15857":"Why does ESPN think New England is gonna trade for every quarterback.","15858":"Is the broadcast just intentionally behind? Their corner thing says 127 Eagles pick is in but they're still talking about fucking Booger JR","15859":"Can they stop talking about a FIU quarterback for half an hour? You're 4 fucking picks behind.","15860":"I wonder how many of the players in this draft are on reddit","15861":"HEY DID YOU GUYS KNOW JAKE FROMM HASN'T BEEN PICKED YET","15862":"For those of yall not following along on the tracker and wondering who the 5 picks were that they didn't even talk about because they were too busy sucking off Jake Fromm\n\nEagles - S K'Von Wallace\n\nBills - WR Gabriel Davis\n\nJets - G Cameron Clarke\n\nVikings - DE James Lynch\n\nCardinals - DT Rashard Lawrence","15863":"ESPN saying they're trying to raise our spirits? I doubt that considering they tell us the personal tragedies of nearly every player picked.","15864":"Wait... is this what has been happening on ABC the past two days...","15865":"Play the draft again","15866":"She was like oh my god","15867":"eject eject eject! Let's talk for weeks about how this draft will be a good break from the drudgery COVID-19 has brought into our lives and then mention it constantly alongside sob stories for every prospect.","15868":"Have none of y'all watched day 3 of previous drafts?

No commercials but each prospect got about 4 minutes worth of breakdown","16198":"they know junkies are going to watch it anyway, so they are appealing to fans who don't know the players.","16199":"Especially with Indy, who (depending on who you ask) feels renewed animosity with the franchise after McDaniels","16200":"They\u2019re spending more time talking about picks than time between picks","16201":"Because everyone worships QBs.","16202":"That piano music ESPN started playing had me trained like one of Pavlov's dogs to think I was about to hear how he had died.","16203":"Deejay Dallas sounds like he has 1 AM set at the abandoned foundry","16204":"They're going to have a whole round of Mr. Irrelevants and just dip when the last pick comes in.","16205":"Maybe they'll try to turn Rodgers into an Edelman-esque player so Love can have some weapons.","16206":"Dude, Luke Bryan sang a song during one of our picks.","16207":"Every single one of the Panthers picks on day 3 have been during commercials. Kenny Robinson was picked during a Sean Payton interview. Barf","16208":"woot woot!  Draft Junkies!","16209":"ESPN has made me miss Rich Eisen and NFL Network","16210":"ESPN needs to go bankrupt.","16211":"But his bar in Nashville is awesome","16212":"and was he like Oh My God, This Was His Song?","16213":"12 est","16214":"Jacksonville","16215":"I think Goodell is drunk!","16216":"Until all the rest of the picks are made.","16217":"All.  Fucking.  Day.","16218":"7 hours. No joke.","16219":"I second your opinion! F**k \u201cthe new normal\u201d.","16220":"Amik Robertson is going to make some team very happy as a slot corner in the 5th. He's good but so small","16221":"IF YOU THINK THE NAME SMITH SOUNDS FAMILIAR!\n\nlike yea, 5% of the population...","16222":"Santonio! No? Priest? No!? This other guy? Sure ok he\u2019s on the list I guess","16223":"Surprised there's no NFL Toronto Blue Jays who is trying to draft all of them lmao","16224":"Wait until you see...a green field.","16225":"Eastern Washington wanted to copy Boise State","16226":"We don't want Ballage on the team haha. All about Jordan Howard","16227":"Quinn has always invested heavily in OL","16228":"Yeah, I didn't even notice","16229":"Eason has way better arm strength over Fromm.","16230":"We(Georgia) don't know. Most told him to stay for another year but I think he would've lost the job this year anyways b\/c our offense needed to change.","16231":"Yup","16232":"And from Florida International at that. Ouch.","16233":"...were we looking for a TE?","16234":"And then he trades with the Cowboys.","16235":"I'll be happy so long as he isn't a Packer.  It'd be great if they not only missed out on such a deep WR class but also didn't get the stellar kid from UW.","16236":"I guess it was a matter of time.  With Mostert and Coleman, the RB position was getting too crowded.","16237":"FCS. Not very good. Hasn't had a winning season since 2001.","16238":"They showed our pick 47 minutes after it happened","16239":"I\u2019ll take him","16240":"He lunged before Devito started his slide and that was a really sudden slide anyway","16241":"they all can't be soldier field sadly.","16242":"ABC","16243":"Its been like this for day 3 the past couple years.  They will just show the picks on the ticker and then recap later on.","16244":"Was honestly my first thought. Just grab him before the Pats do.","16245":"Agreed. Why Buffalo?","16246":"He\u2019s #4 for me. I definitely think he\u2019ll be able to carve out a solid NFL career. Stanley is my #5 and I\u2019m starting to doubt he\u2019ll even get drafted.","16247":"As a UGA fan, all I can say is that Fromm is going to be a great coach one day lol.\n\nVery moderate arm, can make all the intermediate throws but doesn't stretch the field. He's just not physically gifted in any aspect.\n\nOtherwise really great football mind and a consummate leader.","16248":"Crosby is getting old. Better draft a kicker.","16249":"Eason was not a good fit for UW. He has bad habits that the coaching staff failed to mask and he didn't really know the playbook that well from the scuttlebutt around UW. Not to mention, the OC at UW was horrendous and Chis Peterson literally burned out and quit cause of the stress of running a team that had high aspirations.\n\nDon't think another year, a year where UW will essentially have to rebuilt, would have helped.\n\nDon't really think another year would have helped him.","16250":"Depends, sometimes you perform worse that 4th season. Ryan Finley (former QBU (NC State) and current Cincy qb) was often mocked mid 50s or 60s in 2018, he decided to stay another year and got picked at 104.","16251":"Hard to say. There just aren\u2019t a ton of QB-needy teams right now so the pressure isn\u2019t on to take a chance on a guy like him. A couple years ago, I think Eason and Fromm would have been drafted already.","16252":"Him going to the draft this year was kinda surprising, he wasn't great last year and I expected him to return but it did make sense to leave, new HC and next years QB class at the moment looks as good or better at the moment so staying might not have changed his draft stock too much.","16253":"i mean....he probably didn't get to sleep until 1:30.....then he probably needs to get up at 8 to get ready......its a lot of work. there are plenty of people who can help.","16254":"i forgot to get some wings at grocery store :(","16255":"agreed. it would suck ass to be at a wedding table with him.","16256":"Kevin Nealon would have been awesome!","16257":"Bet you Seattle takes him at 133 if he is. He fits our physical profile perfectly (not many in this draft that do) and we badly need CB developmental prospect","16258":"Its the exact same coverage","16259":"ESPN has traditionally been bad.  In years past i liked watching NFL networks online stream, but that is just ESPN now.","16260":"Now they just need to keep the reporters away from him..","16261":"He\u2019s probably thinking, \u201cWelp, at least I\u2019m not Shea Patterson\u201d","16262":"Brett Kollman's coverage is hilarious https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=BWqSfymN1GA\n\nESPN is the only one formally covering it tho","16263":"I\u2019m actually pretty happy with our draft. I would have done things differently but that\u2019s just how Pete\/John roll...","16264":"I don't know what to do with my hands","16265":"I want to die","16266":"Quintez Cephus is literally the exact same type of reciver as Lazard or MVS. Slow but strong","16267":"Ready for us to take moss just because..or Tampa bay lol","16268":"I like every one of their picks and it makes me mad.","16269":"Cancer sucks\n\nEDIT: I read that as Mort, but the point stands","16270":"Anyone know a reason for it? Just old or health issues?","16271":"Hes actually from Navy lol... Wingo got another thing wrong...","16272":"I mostly hate companies and politicians calling front line workers heroes but doing nothing to improve their material conditions or safety.","16273":"The fear porn from the media and pandering from celebs and corporations is really out of control.\n\nBill Maher had a great monologue about this.","16274":"I missed it. Who has a tattoo?","16275":"The only guy who has the qualifications of being on the panel is Riddick... and he's on a 20 minute tape delay **if** he realizes its his turn to talk.","16276":"No","16277":"Yeah dude should rock the bald look yesterday","16278":"Clearly why he slipped","16279":"It\u2019s too late to apologize!!!!!","16280":"It\u2019s only a few hours away.","16281":"Wasn't he awesome the previous season though?","16282":"I'm pretty sure Mel just doesn't want us to see his Jimmy Clausen memorabilia collection.","16283":"God that makes it worse. Feel bad for the guy.","16284":"*due to recent events*","16285":"It makes a lot more sense now that I read the comp. Pace gave yall a 4th next year. What an idiot.","16286":"Marijuana","16287":"Your team has a history of crippling players lmao.  Get the fuck out with this nonsense.  Your boy Snyder played stupid games and ended up giving one of the best LT\u2019s in the league to the niners for peanuts.","16288":"The saints keep trading up so they can pick 1 spot ahead of us, so I guess they thought we were going to take the QB to sit behind Brady but we went with an OLB and another RB instead lol","16289":"Yea he fell way too far imo","16290":"Right, that's also what I mean, as long as he gets to heal up the first 8 weeks, then get him in some blowouts and maybe give him a start or two at the end of the year before taking over as the full time guy in 2021. Kinda like Drew Lock","16291":"True. So 127 to Philadelphia then?","16292":"Come on down!","16293":"He does the 2 PM set at Kittens Gentlemen\u2019s Club","16294":"Ruby Rhod hosting","16295":"Sorry u\/Penis-hat","16296":"I just want some more analysis, dammit. I honestly don't care if Firk Durkle's great-uncle's brother-in-law got smothered to death by wildebeest.","16297":"I hope there aren't any punters drafted because that will just make me miss him even more","16298":"I knew you guys signed somebody but for some reason I could only remember Ballage. I was at his 7 TD game in college, can\u2019t believe he\u2019s so bad in the NFL","16299":"I figured they'd take one considering they moved Hurst.  Then again I guess that might say that they're *set* at the position.","16300":"Don't forget McKinnon","16301":"Ok.  I've still seen that called a penalty, whether it was correct or not.","16302":"I mean you're not wrong, now if only they could remove the space ship that landed on top of it...","16303":"Past 20 years really. Day 3 you are lucky if they talk about every third pick.","16304":"Yeah I get that.  Just seeing him to start the day made me think he was going to do the whole draft.  We do live in unprecedented times after all.","16305":"Ah ok thanks. Had different analysts the past couple days, which is why I was wondering","16306":"He's from Charlotte and was briefly at NC State so I'm ready for my guy to come back home","16307":"Wait Mel has cancer?","16308":"I was just referring to how much he moves his head when he talks, not so much like actually shaking.","16309":"Shit, ESPN fucked me up.","16310":"That too.  Don't tell me to donate.  You guys donate.  You're big multi-billion dollar companies.  Now a lot of companies, like Apple and 3M, has and that is good, don't get me wrong.  I just don't like the feeling that I \"have\" to be depressed because of this virus when I'm trying to make the most of the situation.","16311":"He got it as a teenager and claims he was confused on what it meant","16312":"The new Patriots kicker","16313":"They may just try and grab some udfa at this point if they don\u2019t use one of the next two. Waiting on that 230 qb pick lol","16314":"Fans turn on kickers very fast lol","16315":"He had one year where he was arguably best of the league in 2018. 2017 he was garbage and 2019 he was hot garbage. I know he was good in 2018 but kicker is the most expendable position in the NFL and previous years don\u2019t matter. He\u2019s proven that he\u2019s more often than not unreliable","16316":"Yep im cool with trading our hoard of picks this year for 2021 picks.  Im just afraid of getting more 2020 7ths lol","16317":"I hate Snyder more than you. I didn\u2019t say he wasn\u2019t to blame. Did you read the other Reddit thread this AM. A lot of ppl agreed that Trent turning down the Vikings trade was petty. Mofo","16318":"And wasn\u2019t Snyder. Bruce Allen goober","16319":"could probably use another one the more i think about it...but we really didn't have anyone to come in and play RG. getting 2 guards i like because you don't want to have all your eggs in one basket...and guys get hurt.","16320":"He's barely played a down for the 49ers it was incredibly hard to not forget about McKinnon. ;)","16321":"Nope, a center instead \ud83d\ude02","16322":"Oh shit I read that as Mort.","16323":"Fair enough!\n\nWe went through a similar thing with Bos, though I guess it was more the opposite.
